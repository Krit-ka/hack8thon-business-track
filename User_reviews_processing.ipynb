            "Persona Insight: Fitbit app used to be excellent. it is in decline unless you pay their monthly subscription! i paid £400 for a piece of tech and can only use its full potential if i keep paying! you can shove it fitbit, no doubt you are making fortunes using all the data you have on us too! i used to love my fitbit and have been a loyal customer for over a decade. the app was always great, simple to use, easy to read, good to see how you were doing over time. recently the app changed but the underlying sections remained usable, now the sleep app has been “updated” it is unusable. we comment but fitbit are ignoring us, time to look at other offerings. Sleep tracking is excellent, easy to use with a simple to learn ui. battery life is brilliant, last several days! superb fitness trackers with a very competitive prices. charge 5 worked perfectly and now i am on charge 6, which is just as good with a minor improvements, all adds up to very smooth user experience. great app for cyclists! it's my every day app for recording my sports activities. the segments feature is super addictive. no problem to pay 59 usd per year for it. keep up the good job by continuously adding features! great product and social experience with a positive effect. Each email takes 3-5 working days to get a response, and in my case the support agent took two of those emails to ask the same question twice (adding 10 days to the resolution) it took weeks to resolve a basic problem. a few months back i started tracking my walks. i do 2 miles a day minimum, and just being able to see all the data set me on my journey to lose weight and get fitter. i now use strava, and garmin app together. very good app. i can build my cycling routes easily and also share them with my fellow-cyclists. strava can connect with multiple cycling computers even those that are sold on aliexpress. which makes it easier to follow the routes i build in the strava app. i have been using strava for nearly 3 years. it's great an compatible with my apple watch. i have rated it 4 stars because the have removed feature, making them \"summit\" (premium) features. i use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great. excellent performance but the app hcrashes too much no, put a fix on it. only using the free app version so far for my runs and i really like it.  give it a go. Great website for tracking fitness activities. they could do with more premium features for runners. the site seems very geared towards cyclists. it's a great app, with information that can help people through any type of fitness journey. i appreciate the notifications throughout the day to log my meals. it's super easy to look up the foods i have either by the search bar or barcode. i'd like to see more nutrients/minerals in the nutrient breakdown tab. also less ads would be nice. App has helped me lose weight, eat better, exercise more, reach my goals and stay on track/maintain. great database for tracking food at meals, integration of data to/from other health apps and devices, nice goal setting/tracking features. Great app to track your calories and workouts! searching for food, it is a very thorough and complete database and very easy to find what you need for quick logins. The ability to make and save recipes is a great asset to the app! i've had for 3 years and it's been of invaluable help with my bulking and cutting bodybuilding cycles. brilliant bar code facility. would love if it was possible to duplicate items for multiple meals and days but other than that very user friendly. i’ve used this as a valuable tool to track my calories for the past 8 years. i like that u can put exercises in too. it helps to keep track of the days i exercise, all in one app. i'm amazed by how many foods are in the data bank. if the food i want is not there, i can usually find one similar. the posted columns are very useful and helpful. i especially like the recipes. It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what i'm eating. shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of premium for a pensioner is a little steep. Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight excellent app. taught me well about macro nutrition facts. it’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the upc - only accessible via the paid app. that was a greedy move. This app has helped me on my way of losing 38 pounds in about 3 months! tracking my food and nutritional values has led me to lose 95 lbs. i feel great, too! used for years!! great for calorie counting and keeping track of my nutrition values. Great app easy to use and excellent for daily use. so far the app has helped me lose 18 ibsbrilliant  it is easy to log your foods. has info on many foods and restaurants. great tool. helps me keep track of meals well. excellent as always the best app to use good app. easy to use  used this for years. fantastic my trainer arman at 24 our fitness set this app up for me so that i could track my progress. i also like the articles on recipes and nutritional information, and sometimes i try to make the dishes. the ability to find specific foods from stores and restaurants makes it easy to do your daily check in. another great feature is the bar code reader, meaning less typing. Great app, keeps me honest! really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. beautiful product with many options to assess your meals. i started using the app after a heart attack. i use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. it's great. The app helps me track my macros, so i can keep my protein and fat high and carbs low. functionality is great and relatively user friendly. the database often has any food i need. i've kept the extra weight off for 5 years now.  myfitnesspal is amazing! it has been a huge help in my weight loss journey. the food database is huge, and the barcode scanner makes logging meals super easy. it tracks my progress and syncs with my other fitness apps. highly recommend for anyone looking to get healthier!\n",

Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of snapshots. Two watches (charge 4 and 5) died right after one year of normal wear, not even exercising, or in the shower. all they offer was 35% off. doesn't even offer servicing like apple does. customer service is utterly useless and does not treat you as a human being. waste of money. i like it but unfortunately it never picks up the stairs even if i'm walking up 8 floors. charge 4 lasted 2 year, the plastic connection bit on the side of the fitbit that clips onto your strap snapped off. charge 2 stopped working after 2 year also. i have a fitbit versa 3. it is literally the worst health and lifestyle watch in the history of mankind. the versa 3 loses gps signal in the countryside, in built up areas, in residential areas, basically everywhere. it then uses some ridiculous algorithm to work out what you've done whilst the signal was lost. pathetic. do not buy. Tried to return the fitbit as under warranty involves printing off a trees worth of paper in consignment notes etc. You have to go on hold to the courier company selected by google within australia. Nearly an hour later someone picks up and agrees you can’t do this online and they book you a pick up slot. However that window at your home address is between 9am and 5pm and you have to be home as they won't just pick it up. i see myself and many others have their fitbit account hacked. some of the responses on their helpcenter goes to say that the customer read the email wrong which is kind of funny. i recommend a garmin watch, their software is also very good and can link up to other third party apps. Customer service is a joke. never ending runaround just to get a replacement for a defective versa 3. shambles of a device. didn't last 18 months and they expect me to buy a new one at 35% discount. absolute joke. don't buy these products, they aren't made to last. Had a charge 4 and it performed pretty well apart from it not linking up with my phone after a period and then the bit that attached to the strap snapped and it was no longer usable. Was still in warranty but to try and contact fitbit to replace the product is a joke. i won't be buying a fitbit again. i can no longer scan a barcode on, say, a loaf of bread without signing up for their premium service. what a joke! i won't be using this app again. so long, mFP!\n",

            "Persona Insight: i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. \"Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back\" \"I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first\" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite \"screw yous\". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the \"you find your own answer in our list of faq's\".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! \"absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother\" \"they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money\"  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it \"glitched\" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the \"free trial\". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time \"searching\" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for \"premium\" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!\n",

            "Persona Insight: CNN.com will feature iReporter photos in a weekly Travel Snapshots gallery. Please submit your best shots of New York for next week. Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of snapshots. i love fitbit and am obsessed with my watch. over the past 4 years my fitbit has stopped working twice and both times they ask me to send it back and have sent me a brand new one! not many companies would do that so i think it's great. i generally find it so great for tracking all my exercise too and there’s so much you can do on the app. i would never move to any other watch and always recommend them. my fitbit stopped working, customer service was useless and just offered me discount on a new purchase. when i asked how to make a complaint they went from replying promptly to completely ignoring me. i only wish i'd read the reviews years ago as i certainly would've avoided this company. i know they had a premium service that could go in depth but now all basic functions are behind that paywall. my advice: use a different app. used to be a great app, now they have changed it so you need to pay for the most basic of functions. The app runs well most of the time but sometimes doesn't work as well. other than the negative, a good app. they need to sort the money business out. sort it out strava! good at dealing with specific enquiries on rides, but there are some long highlighted general issues that have been raised many times by different people. happy with the overall use of the site via a pc, not so much so on the app. going the paid route opens up so much more and this is both insightful and in my case, helps motivate me. i find the menu easy to navigate, and the info on calories and nutrients is very helpful. search function in “add a food” has some incorrect calorie counts. system automatically adds my exercise calories to my daily total. i can’t opt out of that without upgrading to premium. i have been using myfitnesspal for many years and i had bariatric surgery 3 years ago and this is a very handy tool to use to track. what i used to like i was able to scan my food for free. however now i write my food in because for scanning it isn't free anymore. i still like tracking calories even though i write them in.  myfitnesspal has become my de facto way of keeping track of calories. its accurate, extremely easy to use and would be difficult to do without. this app has a very extensive data base so makes it easy to track my daily food intake. My fitness pal is a brilliant app for managing everything linked to a healthy lifestyle. it is easy to use and if you subscribe to the premium service then you get fantastic value for money. i personally use the basic service for free as my only requirement is the food diary. you will not be disappointed using my fitness pal, and i will guarantee that. i've been using this app to track workouts and meals for years. i trust its data more than any other app i've used. it’s app is easy to use and they everything imaginable listed! i still use the free app and am tempted to try the updated version. Myfitnesspal is right on. always room for improvement, especially for people who don't eat processed food. having to continually put in ingredients i choose to eat is somewhat challenging, especially since i often substitute the alternative ingredients in recipes. i use mFP to track my weight and calories, and it has helped me achieve my fitness goals through the years. fitness pal is easy to use, to check my daily nutrients (calories, carbs, fiber, etc). most of my meal choices are already included in the data. The app is easy to use and perfect for managing my fitness goals. easy ti use and upload myfeedback which was welcomed by the company i bought from. i've been using it consistently for past 2 months and i'm literally seeing the results on weekly basis. i have been using this app daily for over a year. the workout feature is hit and miss, but basically it works well. it’s easy to communicate with other bikers in the community and share experiences. This app is simple to use and really helps me stay on track. wo helpful and easy. it does what i need it to do when i use it right. it has what i want. i’m a long time user and credit my fitness pal with providing both information and the discipline needed to first lose weight and then maintain. i have many friends who complain about not being able to lose weight but have no clue about how many calories, carbs, fats etc they consume. additionally they don’t understand how few calories are actually needed by the human body per day or the amount of exercise needed per day. i was recently diagnosed with gallbladder and liver issues. myfitnesspal has made it much easier to visualize if i’m achieving my macro and nutrient goals for those conditions. with their premium features, it has been worth it! i like that i can scan food to get the nutrition info. i started the south beach diet at my dr’s recommendation and found it hard to find information within the app to follow it. good to count calories and keep trsvk. expensive to go premium.\n",

            "Persona Insight: i am too traumatized to go into detail. my advice is to steer clear of this company. dealing with customer services is a surreal experience. a trustscore of 1 out of 5 should tell you all you need to know. An expensive bit of kit, which has been reliable for the two years i have owned it. my really big concern is having spent a lot of money on its initial purchase to really benefit you have to then pay to use all the functions within the app. knowing what i know now in no way, shape or form would buy another fitbit. realistically at its purchase the complete and full app should come with it all included. i don’t get fooled twice and i hope none of you out there get fooled once. i’m writing this regarding a versa 4 my wife bought for me as a christmas gift in december 2022. this watch recently died and could not be reset, less than 6 months after warranty ended. fitbit support offered a 35% discount on a new one instead of replacing it.  don't buy this product or do so at your own risk.  fitbit charge5 stopped syncing with the mobile app 12apr 2024. i bought it in april 2023. i tried all the steps available online and on the fitbit community forum. nothing worked. 16 apr 2024 - i had a live chat with fitbit onine. They were helpful and my fitbit is nowsyncing with mobile app. i was totally unaware they could do this, would not refund payment. be very careful if you use their app. it keeps you healthy  you help me stay on track, easy to use. if yiy switch phone they won't honor it they blame it on apple very dissatisfied customer.\n",

Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of snapshots. i’ve tried contacting fitbit twice over the last month and nobody has bothered to acknowledge either of my emails. the warranty is absolutely useless if nobody is there to fix an issue when it presents. i don’t know how such an established business is allowed to operate like this with no accountability. i will definitely go to a competitor who can be trusted to honour a warranty. i've been a fitbit customer for years and have always been really happy but since this merger with google their customer service has really gone downhill. my fitbit has just broken but is within warranty. last time this happened i just got on to customer services and they sorted me a new one before the end of the day. this morning i've spent 2 hours on customer services unable to verify my account because it's not with registered with google. the person kept telling me it was my fault and there was nothing they could do. not sure what to do now and fitbit don't seem interested in trying to help or retain me as a customer. i don't know what happened to fitbit.  now you have to order through the google store- beware you can’t return orders. i am out over $100 and no o w will get back to me!!!! it was free before, but now all main core features are under subscription. i have a free account in the uk, which i’ve never paid for. i used it twice in san francisco for two bike rides and strava have charges me two lots of £47.99 on the same day!! the app never asked for permission or credit card details. they just helped themselves to my money. i really don't know how!i will be cancelling my account and reporting the fraudulent transaction to my credit card provider. avoid!! i inadvertently bought a 14 month subscription thinking it was a free trial (the get two months free causing the confusion) however the response to my email (cancelling my paid for subscription and sorting out a refund) was done quickly and without any fuss. only feedback to strava, maybe think about how promotions are worded to avoid confusion in the future.\n",

            "Persona Insight: Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out \"troubleshooting\" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable \"third pin\" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told \"my case did not apply for a refund\". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all.\n",
