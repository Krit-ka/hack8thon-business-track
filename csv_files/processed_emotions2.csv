i had a pretty major surgery and was bed bound for a while. i've never been strong or particularly in shape but i'm finding things like lifting a gallon of milk difficult. i was also 130lbs this time last year but that was largely due to not eating. 

i'm hoping to get some kind of advice on ways to build lean muscle for someone in my situation. i've never tried to build muscle in my life and there's so much conflicting information online. i'll need to do the exercises at home and i'd really prefer something that i can do while watching tv or listening to a book. 

what equipment can i buy? what exercise can i do or what guides can i follow?

1.0,1ezx97c,David-Leatherhoff,1,Advice ,"hello, everyone. 

for the last 6 months i have been working from home managing my online business. 

i work for 12 to 13 hours a day and have one day off a week. 

99.9 percent of the day i'm sitting i even eat in front of my computer the only time i move is to do some cleaning , getting food , bathroom etc.. 

lately i have been experiencing some fatigue when i walk also my legs ( specially my knees ) hurt.

 i'm sure it's because of lack of movement so i decided i should try to do some form of exercise that won't take so much time like for example i do some exercise for 10 minutes every 1 hour or so. 


what advice can you give me ? what exercises do you suggest? 


thanks in advance ",gratitude
1.0,1ezy6zo,HonestOrKind,0,Calorie count body weight exercise vs walking,"i am a very beginner when it comes to working out. i am 30. when i was younger i was in shape. i used to be on a swim team and would weight train twice a day in addition to swimming. used to be able to swim multiple miles. i could do 100 pushups at a time without a huge struggle. 

now i’m terribly out of shape. haven’t worked out in ten years. spent many of those years smoking and drinking. now i’m totally sober and looking to get into shape. i’m roughly 5’ 11” and 170 lb. i’ll be lucky if i could do 20 pushups at a time and my arms would definitely burn for the rest of the day. i’ll be lucky if i can run for 3 minutes without being totally winded, and i would definitely be sore after this. 

i’m looking to start off gradual…as one does. 

i’m looking into making a daily routine i do regardless of what region i’m focusing on, and then having a specific region to focus on each day. i plan on using mostly body weight and dumb bell exercises because they are the safest options for working out alone. (no risk of dropping a bar on myself.)

when i was younger i never counted calories or tried to keep track of anything. i just did what the coach told me to do. if they said swim a 500 i seam a 500. if they said to do push ups i did push ups. if they said it was back and shoulder day, then that’s what i did. if they said it was chest day, that’s what i did. they had a varied routine that focused different areas all figure out…in other words they did all the prep work and all the thinking for me. 

now i need to be able to do that for myself.  i’ve got this very basic workout that i just typed up…and i have some questions about the calories or purpose of these exercises. 

this is the daily workout before the specific body region exercises. 

daily basic bodyweight exercises: will increase every month for the first year.  

3 sets of 5 regular push ups. (increase by 2 per month.) 
3 sets of 5 wide push ups. (increase by 2 per month. no more than ten per set. maximum of 3 sets.) 
3 sets of 5 diamond push ups. (increase by 2 per month. no more than ten per set. maximum of 3 sets.) 
3 sets of 15 sit ups. (increase by 5 per month. no more than 30 per set for the first year. no more than three sets.) 
3 sets of 15 crunches. (increase by 5 per month. no more than 30 per set for the first year. no more than three sets.) 
3 sets of 15 jumping jacks (increase by 2 per month. no more than 30 per set for the first year. no more than three sets.) 
3 sets of 15 lunges. (increase by 5 per month. no more than 30 per set for the first year. no more than three sets.) 
3 sets of 15 squats (increase by 5 per month. no more than 30 per set for the first year. no more than three sets.) 

so my questions pertains to calories burned. after day one of this workout, i would have burned a measly 63 calories. at the end of the elevated routine by month 6, i would be burning 120 calories. 

this is not a lot of calories at all. and has me questioning the value of even doing this exercise when i can just walk for 20 minutes to burn the same amount of calories. or 40 minutes 6 months in. 

are these exercises going to increase my muscle mass and help me burn calories in the long run? 

i will also be doing some stretching and yoga before doing this routine, and i will have a routine after this using dumbbells for each day targeting a different muscle group. i might do back and shoulders on monday, arms and chest on tuesday. legs on friday. etc. 

i know some cardio would do me good and i will introduce some swimming or cycling into this at some point sooner rather than later. 

is this worth doing? am i missing something? any advice or recommendations?

1.0,1ey0uya,Nubian_Cavalry,12,Rate this advice from my family,"
last year, i decided to gradually change aspects of my lifestyle to lose weight. i try to go to the gym every 2 days, sometimes scheduling conflicts make me wait 3. i eat whatever i feel like but gradually introducing less calorie dense whole foods which i am really enjoying. 

in the past month, i actually started to track calories which opened my eyes to how dense certain foods are and i’m altering my diet to compensate.

i’ve been walking 7-12k steps everyday. even if i need to do it in my own house.

i’m down over 20 pounds. this does not sit well with my family, they don’t outright say it but the way they love to scream at me and badger me over this, they think i’m fucking anorexic, i eat like a bird, i need to stop giving a fuck about sugar, but at the same time they tell me carbs are evil and i should cut them out completely, but they don’t cooperate and still buy high calorie junk carbs.

they say i should eat more protein, but tell me chicken and fish are bad sources and suggest ground beef, hot dogs, sausage egg and cheese with butter.

in the next month, i’ll be working an at home job from 8am to 4 pm, and in addition to that projects, which basically requires i sit in front of a computer all day. something i haven’t done before. 

this is going to screw over my routine, especially as we share a car now and i’m unable to just go whenever i want, they tell me i should wake up early to do but the problem is they never let me fucking sleep, and whenever i have to go early they either suddenly need the care or insist we carpool then take 2 hours to put their shoes on, only to tell me i have 30 minutes or they’ll leave me stranded till 8 pm. basically just an excuse to chump whatever i’m trying to do. and they’re starting to do this with my walking as well, getting upset when i don’t listen to them on how i walk too much.

so in the absolute worst case scenario i will need to fully commit to eating a certain way if i can’t walk or exercise as much as i want. staying in a deficit. that’s not fine with them either. they think i’m doing some aggressive routine and want a six pack or already have a goal weight in mind when really i’m just making gradual changes. that’s all i’m doing. 

my mother and brother's suggestions boil down to this:

* 150g of protein every single day, nothing on fiber. they got upset when i said that was good advice that will improve my fat loss.
* zero carbs
* eat in a surplus
* core exercises to burn my stomach fat
* stop weighing my food. i can eat as much as i want as long as it’s protein. hell they’d get especially pissed when i measure sauces or butter or sugar.
* 3 full plateful meals a day, then i go to the gym at night. this has never worked for me honestly. and clearly isn’t making my brother any less fat or more muscular 
* stop walking as much as i do
* look into “body shaping”
* sleep better. no they don’t plan on shutting up at night. i should just sleep better.

i’ll add more as i remember it, that conversation was just a screaming match, and i’m so sorry if this doesn’t sound coherent.

i’m willing to hear you guys out on this. ",neutral
1.0,1ey9phj,ChronoHvH,4,How to make strength training more interesting?,"hello r/exercise!

i'm curious on how other people made their training and workouts more interesting and easier to have the motivation to go back to consistently.

personally my type of activity doesn't involve much strength training or working out in the traditional gym sense. i usually do things such as skateboarding, ice skating, hiking, and golf to stay active. i've always kind of had a stocky build and have started to lean out by eating healthier and i want to try and be more active in a tradition gym sense because i want to have more physical strength as well as gaining more muscle definition. 

the issue is that i find weight lifting incredibly boring compared to the other activities i already do. skateboarding as well as ice skating and golf all have techniques and progression in learning new things that makes me feel like i'm constantly learning something new or at least overcoming the barriers and pushing my knowledge and fear thresholds of what i can do.

-- weight lifting has obvious progression, getting strong and changing your body positively; but after you learn the initial techniques it's just kind of boring because all i am noticing is a number go up until i plateau and have to change something. yes the mental battle is there, overcoming pain and what you think you can do; mindset and all that. i know that is all there, i'm just struggling with motivation knowing that i'm just driving to a gym to do the same thing on repeat - doing arms, back, leg etc. 

are there ways that you've developed your weight training to make it feel more interesting, trying different ways to work and progress the same muscle groups or ways that you might have game-ified your workouts to ""feel"" as if it had progression even though you knew you were progressing and getting stronger/healthier?",neutral

1.0,1eue993,tyranttigrex,4,Alternatives for squat and deadlifts?,"a bit of a lengthy one sorry.

so for context i’m lifting not to get primarily super strong or huge but just to supplement my bjj. i grapple 4-5 times a week and would usually lift 2/3 times a week (upper, lower and full body/ endurance training)

my old routine would suggest me to target hamstrings and quads separately so i have an excuse to skip squats/ deadlifts for leg press, single leg deadlifts, extension and curls, along with lower back extensions with a bit of weight. 


but given i recently switched my routine to follow a friends since their one seems a bit more time friendly, i’m a bit hesitant on doing squats and deadlift as my family has had a history of lower back injuries (slip disc) and people who grapple are known to have terrible lower back at some point. 

basically my question, is there a solid alternative for squats and deadlift without having to add a few more exercises to compensate and target the muscles that are left out (from doing squats and deadlift)


i’m also looking into a personal trainer to check my form to maybe provide some reassurance since my new gym offers a free pt for the first one.

1.0,1esnmpu,DragonWolf888,0,[Introducing] The Art of Dragon Slaying: A New Workout for Strength and Unity,"greetings, fellow travelers and seekers of strength! gather 'round, for i have returned from a journey deep into the earth’s core, where i discovered an ancient practice passed down by a mystical species. this practice, which i now bring to you, is known as dragon slaying.

but let us be clear— this is not just another workout. this is a daily ritual, a path that unites the body from core to limb in a way that few other practices can. the foundation of dragon slaying is simple yet powerful: one exercise per body group, one set per exercise. the sequence is key— we begin by awakening the core, the center of our strength, then move to empowering the legs, the pillars of our foundation, and finally fortify the upper body, our sword &amp; shield

a dragon slaying example routine is below (my personal workout), which is done on the floor, with 2 \* 25lb dumbbells:

core activation:

1 x 30 sec plank

1 x 30 sec side plank (left)

1 x 30 sec side plank (right)

we start by engaging the core, the bridge between the upper and lower body. this activation prepares the entire body for the work ahead.

legs empowerment:

1 x 30+ dumbbell hang tiptoe squats

next, we move to the legs. our unique squat, performed on tiptoes, targets the knees, ankles, and every muscle in the legs, promoting strength and stability.

upper body fortification:

1 x 15 mid-squat, cross-body, dumbbell rotations (below left hip to above right shoulder, straight arms)

1 x 15 mid-squat, cross body, dumbbell rotations (below right hip to above left shoulder, straight arms)

1 x 20 dumbbell chest press, with

1 x 15 chest flyes

1 x 15 dumbbell pullover

1 x 15 dumbbell overhead tricep extensions

1 x 20 dumbbell bent over rows

1 x 15 dumbbell shoulder press

1 x 15 dumbbell curls

finally, we strengthen the upper body with a series of exercises that target the chest, back, shoulders, and arms. each set is carefully chosen to ensure balance and power.

how slaying dragons has helped me:

since embracing the sacred art of dragon slaying, i have witnessed a profound transformation in both body and mind. my muscles, once mere parts of my form, now feel like a unified force—pumped, strong, and vibrant. this newfound strength has granted me a deep sense of presence, especially in my legs, as if i truly inhabit every inch of my being. unlike the aftermath of traditional bodybuilding's leg day, which often leaves the legs weary and sore, dragon slaying fills them with life, making them feel powerful and fully engaged.

one of the greatest boons of this practice is the flexibility it bestows upon my daily life. as i navigate the demands of my career, the time to visit the gym often eludes me. yet, with dragon slaying, i can summon my dumbbells at any moment, engaging in a complete and purposeful workout that revitalizes every muscle group without the need for an hour-long session. even amidst the chaos of the day, i can perform my dragon slaying rituals between meetings, emerging from each session energized and ready to face the challenges ahead.

as a dedicated practitioner of yoga, i long sensed a missing element in my practice— a strength component that didn’t require acrobatic feats. dragon slaying has seamlessly filled this void, bringing the essence of yoga—union and balance into the realm of strength training. through these focused, single-set exercises, i've achieved a unique harmony with my muscles.

the philosophy:

dragon slaying is about unifying the body, not breaking it down. we do one exercise per body group, and only one set. the focus is on filling the muscles with blood, bringing life and consciousness to each part of the body, rather than pushing them to the point of destruction. this practice is not about size, but about strength, vitality, and connection. we want to squeeze the muscles at the right time, for the right pump.

you can perform this routine once or even twice a day. for those serious about their journey, the second session can focus on supporting muscles like calves, forearms, and traps. the goal is not to exhaust but to energize— to emerge from each session feeling more alive and more connected.

a daily ritual:

dragon slayers are those who commit to this practice every day. it’s not about occasionally picking up the dumbbells; it’s about embracing this path as part of  daily life. each set is a battle won, each session a dragon slain. and through this discipline, we become stronger, not just in body, but in mind and spirit, so that we can tackle the other dragons of every day life.

every person can slay dragons. they can do some exercises, here and there. they can slay some dragons, here and there. some days-- 5 exercises. the next day, all the exercises. the day after that, practice is missed. those people slay dragons.

on the other hand, there are dragon slayers. dragon slayers are people who slay their dragons, every day. they hit each muscle group. they slay the dragon. and like in a video game, their completed exercise sets are their slaying of dragons, or killing a difficult boss, or rescuing a noble princess. they are dragon slayers because they do their strength yoga every day.

so, fellow adventurers, the choice is yours. will you join me on this path and become a true dragon slayer? the journey awaits.

further reading for the true seekers

the symbol of dragon slaying: the symbol of dragon slaying draws directly from the iconic dragon statues in spyro the dragon on the ps1. this choice is intentional, reflecting the deeper, symbolic meaning of “slaying” in this practice.

in spyro, the relationships to other dragons are not through destruction, but through liberation. spyro frees dragons from captivity (the statue they are captured in). similarly, dragon slaying as a workout is about freeing your muscle groups from isolation, bringing them together to work in harmony. it’s a metaphor for transformation, where the challenge isn’t just about conquering but about achieving unity and strength. if this symbol resonates with you, and you happen to have a 3d printer at home, a 3d model of the spyro dragon can be [downloaded here for free from cults3d](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/art/dragon-statue-with-base-spyro) (not my file, but shout-out to the owner). i've printed this dragon and have it on my office desk as a reminder of the practice :)

i supplement the leg days with some abs exercises like dead bugs and rkc planks,  the push days with shoulder dislocations (rotating shoulders with broomsticks/bands), and the pull days with low resistance face pulls. makes sense?

(3) any other flexibility, stretching or posture advice you can give? i was also thinking of giving https://www.reddit.com/r/flexibility/wiki/starting_to_stretch a go

just last week i got into the gym after seeing his progress and go with him after work. my start weight is 101kg with a goal of 75kg. however this week i've done 4 gym sessions back to back with him targeting legs, arms, chest &amp; cardio all on different days not the same. 

however my arms are in agony and my legs to the point in which going downstairs i have to go extremely slowly to the point it's like i'm riding a horse lol. anyone got any tips on how to relieve the pain? i know i'm gonna get doms until my body adjusts itself naturally to the new changes but surely theirs a way to take some pressure away from the effected areas?

currently i do bicep curls, tricep extensions, and counter/table pushups. i would like to add something to fill in any gaps in muscles worked? back maybe? (note that i have a separate abs/core routine)

 i do my exercises in my small office during work hours, so there are some restrictions to what i can/will do.

1. it must be something i can do standing. it can’t be on the floor.
2. it must only include dumbbells, no other equipment, benches, etc.

i did the push training session and felt tired and sore for the next few days after. today i saw an ad from a gym further away from i am than what i would like but it got my attention. the ad said to that do full body workouts instead because it reduces the stress on the whole body. the additional stress from typical muscle group workout days lead causes additional stress on the body which reduced recovery.

reason for post: so i’m currently undergoing a “personal care” period of my life. so i’ve done things to achieve this but 1 of the things i’m having trouble with is doing stuff for my physical health. so a family member recommended doing walks with a weighted backpack. this appeals to me because i could do it while dog walking which would help me with motivation. so i got a big sturdy backpack (the kind you might have if you’re hiking and camping), filled a bunch of 2 litre bottles with water (so each bottle is roughly 2kg) and i adjusted the amount of bottles in the bag that feels comfortable and uncomfortable (which is roughly 10kg). i haven’t started yet but be doing research and i get mixed messages. so i was wondering if this exercise would be effective and what areas of my body would be affected? the main goal is to lose weight, get fitter and build strength. it would be nice to build muscle but that’s not the main goal (yet).

i am turning 29 in sep end and i have been active since i was 23/24. initially, i used to hot yoga where the studio provided workouts, not just limited to hot yoga. we used to do cardio, strength training, mat pilates &amp; more while lifting weights. i was a beginner into excercising but overtime, built up to it. it helped me really tone my body and it was the first time i felt really great about my body. fast forward to sep 2021, i got married, moved across the country &amp; started my master's. the changes all at once made it challenging to stay on top of my workout routine. 8 months into my marriage, in april 2022, i noticed i had gained quite a bit of weight. i had somewhat of a regular working out regime except one month where it was quite challenging. nonetheless, i went back to it.  except, moving across the country, i have not found a similar hot yoga studio. as such, i have done lots of at home workouts (particulary following sydney cummings houdyshell). 

from jan 2023-dec 2023, i followed her irregularly and overall, struggled with my routine as my education was taking a toll on me along with many other personal challenges. however, since jan 2024, i feel like i am finally finding the grove of things. 

i have been doing her 60 mins s&amp;c, cardio &amp; hiit workouts. i have also been mindful of my eating habits, making sure i'm eating healthy. i have seen amazing results but would like to see more results. i am 5'1 and weight about 57 kg. during sydney's 60 min workouts, i have progressed from being able to burn 400 calories to an average of 470-515 per workout.  i have noticed a big change in quality of my sleep, physical &amp; mental self. however, recently, i started feeling that perhaps i should also start adding more pilates.

i considered move with nicole on yt &amp; have done 1 of her workouts but found it to be overall easy. there were 1-2 challenging pieces but i was overall able to completel the workout and wasn't feeling sore the next day at all. this left me feeling if what i am doing will have an impact on my body? i am trying to understand what my body needs more to ensure consistent results. i workout 4 times a week. i am willing to add more, if and necessary. i workout at home as i do not like the gym. any advice and insight would be appreciated. thank you.

never been a big gym fan but i think i am eventually open to being one. currently i have weighted bands that i formerly used. i’ve always been a super weak person and never able to run for long at all. so as far as strength goes i’m at the bottom of the totem pole. cant do anything like pull ups barely can do pushups about 8 at a time ",curiosity

1.0,1edukag,luva137,4,I'm on my school's swim team but I have close to no endurance or strength.,"i've never swam competitively until my freshman year of high school when i was told to pick a sport by my parents.  swim seemed easy to me (i was wrong) even though i have never been a strong or athletic person - my arms are frequently compared to spaghetti because of how small they are.  since i dont exercise, i have awful endurance, too.  i didn't expect to even like swimming, but i completely fell in love and want to continue the rest of school.

my technique has been good from the beginning, naturally.  i'm small but my starts can clear half the pool and i am very fast, but after the first flip turn i lose my breath and all my momentum goes away, even if i pace myself.  i have tried looking for exercise plans or apps that will help me build strength in my shoulders/core specifically but most of them i need to pay for or i have trouble following the routines.

i feel like if my endurance and lung capacity improves then my strength will follow, but i don't know how to do that.  i don't have access to a pool to practice in, and i'm hoping somebody here knows any way for me to train and practice for next season so i start strong and compete better.

even if it's just one exercise i could do without equipment, which i dont have beyond a yoga mat, i would really appreciate it.  also if people have swim tips or any other advice for a 15 year old girl when trying to exercise?",love

0.83,1ebigvk,Ruganzu,7,My weightlifting routine improvements needed,"so i've been exercising now for about a few months, maybe three. i progressed to the point where i'm kind of at a plateau and i do feel that i get mixed responses as far as what i should do. 

my routine for the most part works like this; i do legs once a week and different parts of the upper body three to four times a week. within a upper body, for example i will do 15 reps of 325 lb for ab crunches for both sides and middle area for one set- for 3 sets, then i'll either do bench press for 135, for five sets, or the back pulls for 110 or 115 lb for five sets depending on what i did last time just to switch things up and not be the same. then i'll do some shoulders for five sets and by that time an hour has easily passed if not more. and i'll call it a day come back the next and hit biceps and triceps for 5 sets and mix up between the already mentioned routine...

however sometimes i feel like while i'm doing the sets and going through the motions, i'm getting more fatigued than i am a burn or a good pump the longer i go. so recently i've been experimenting with instead of doing five sets for example for bench press and being done with chest i'll do the five sets of the 135 and then lower the weight and do another three sets and then lower that continually until i get to the bar and do that same thing for every of the body parts mentioned. 

the issue with that however is, with my regular routine i'm already hitting an hour in the gym and  i feel like when i try to do the new routine with the incrementally lowering of the weights i was going almost  into 2 hours in the gym  and i had only done two to three  movements because of just how long it takes to rest, take a plate off, do five sets with rest in between, and keep decreasing before i'm done with a body part. 

so i guess my questions are 

1) thoughts on my regimen?

2) is the newer routine ideal for increasing pump or am i going about it the wrong way

3) is 1+ hour in the gym pushing it?  

4) what advice would you say to better my gains

however, recently i noticed that with the current weights i've achieved over 3 months of steady increase, i now find myself in situations where i'm unable to complete my sets, despite explicitly not working myself to failure. 

sets until failure aren't my go to thing, because i don't feel like i should be failing sets, besides, if i fail they set then surely it won't yield the desired progress? 🤔 

on their other hand, i am not sure, but i feel like the heavier weights impact my form in certain scenarios, thus again, not allowing me to get them desired results/effects. 

so my question is rather straight forward: am i going to halt my progress with dropping a few kgs in certain exercises? i'm thinking dumbbells -2kg, machines -1 peg and barbell -5kg? 

i workout 4x10 sets since i got back to it (each exercise day 12+ exercises), so would it maybe worth going 4x8 or 3x10? i don't know if this is relevant but ive got ""burst"" type muscles, where i can do excessive weights 4-5 times, but not ""endurance"" muscles, where i could go 12-14 reps (i simply fatigue around 8-9, so 10 reps is always a ""last push).

1.0,1e55tz2,ScottHK,5,A Couple of Questions About Cardio,"i'm trying to lose a few pounds and am doing multiple things to address that.  one of those has been riding an indoor bike my roommate has.  initially i was trying to do like a 10 minute warm-up, 10 more intense, and then 10 back at the first level, with the goal of burning some calories and increasing my heart health by putting it under some strain.  i was sometimes getting into the 140 bpm range for a while and maybe neared 150.

last week, though, while looking further into one of my health apps i found out this was way too hard for a non-pro athlete and maybe borderline dangerous.  further, it said that, for me, 115-125 bpm was the best range for trying to lose weight, which is my main current goal.

so since then i've been going for 'slow and steady' in that range, which actually took some doing at first, and have done pretty well overall, usually getting 80% or better in that range.

so my question is, should i still turn up the heat for awhile into the 130s after i've done 30 or 40 minutes in that range, to stress my heart a little bit and make it stronger over time?  or should i wait until i've lost the 20ish more pounds i'm trying to use before i start pushing it more?  i want to be safe but would like to also improve my health overall.

program usually done mon, wed, fri with sunday as an optional 4th day if i am recovered and ready to train. tue, thu, sat or wed, fri, sunday works too. most likely will not do forth day only when i deload/have been going light.

days in between are rest if very sore/i need to recover or are shoulders, arms and abs days (so i decide how many i want per week depending on how i feel) for shoulders i will do machine incline shoulder press+lat raise variant minnimum adding face pulls (lying or standard)+db shoulder press if i want. the arm days are usually a rp video or some other arm day program.

i'm now about 140lbs (5'7"") but it's muscle and not fat. i can literally flex and see it so it feels good 😊 

my goals aren't for looks, though i consider it an added bonus. i would like to age gracefully, and so painful knees at 32 is what pushed me to start this. i know i can't stop or they'll start to hurt again so i have a nice built in forced committment 😅 i also may want children and i know that pregnancy/parenthood is easier if you're fit.

i still have this little pooch (getting some abs in there under the fat!) on my stomach. my trainer works cardio and abs in a lot for me, as well as standard upper and lower body days. i know diet is a big thing, but my husband and i are quite good. we eat lots of veggies and plant based protein when we can, but we still eat meat. i know carbs are needed, and i could probably do with portion control 😜 so i may or may not work on that lol

i would love an exercise stationary bike to put in the basement to add cardio to my life more consistently. i know fat in the stomach area for women especially is tricky, so that's the hope that cardio will help than just weight training. if i'm weight training at the gym with the trainer and learning the ropes, i can bike at home until i eventually shift to my own at home gym with free weights and bands etc. (future goal!)

for now, i'm happy with my trainer at the gym and she's happy to show me stuff i can do at home when i eventually shift. but i need a bike!

0.71,1e41nyl,strengthtoovercome,0,Functional fitness exercise database in Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets for strength training (version 1.8 update),"hey r/exercise community, 

i created a functional fitness exercise database in microsoft excel and google sheets for strength training – it’s a free resource to help keep all of your strength training exercises organized and quickly accessed in an easy-to-use spreadsheet for your workouts (https://www.reddit.com/r/personaltraining/s/cvi4juymcv). i am constantly updating the exercise database each month with new equipment, exercises, and search filters - so i wanted to share a quick summary of the additions to the database for july. 

the highlight of this update is adding the sandbag (normal) as a primary equipment item, 108 new lunge variations (forward, reverse, lateral, walking) and 23 new resistance band exercises. a full breakdown of all of the updates in version 1.8 is listed below, as well as the free download link to get your updated copy of the database.

more about the exercise database:

it is time consuming to sift through all the exercise information available on the internet (multiple exercise databases, youtube videos, fitness pages/social media), so i made this to have all of the data in one spreadsheet that can be quickly filtered for your exercise search. the database has more than 25 search filters available for over 1750 + functional exercises - allowing you to find the information you need in seconds when designing fitness programs or learning new movement patterns. 

the fitness library also includes exercises using the barbell, dumbbells, kettlebells, gymnastics rings, parallette bars, calisthenics, clubbells, indian clubs, maces, the bulgarian bag, the heavy sandbag, the landmine attachment, suspension trainer, sliders and other functional equipment that you may not have used for your current workouts. all exercises requiring you to move, stabilize, and develop functional and pain free strength.

in this version 1.8 update, i have added the following to the exercise database:

-	added “sandbag” as a new “primary equipment” item.
-	added 108 new lunge variations (forward, reverse, lateral, walking).
-	added 23 new resistance band exercises.
-	added 15 new march variations. 
-	added 15 new l sit variations.
-	added 11 new clubbell exercises.
-	added 9 new cyclist squat variations.
-	added 7 new cossack squat variations.
-	added 7 new bulgarian split squat variations.
-	added 5 new planche variations.
-	added 5 new mountain climber variations.
-	added 4 new box step up variations.
-	added 4 new push up variations.
-	added 12 other miscellaneous exercises. 
-	added “bodyweight” in name description for all bodyweight exercises
-	changed “strongman sandbag” to “heavy sandbag”, as these are also used in crossfit and other applications. not sure which name is more appropriate  - feedback welcomed on this one. 
-	categorized various macebell and clubbell exercises as “ballistic” under “exercise classification”
-	corrected 4 kettlebell/dumbbell suitcase loaded carry “load position” to “suitcase”.
-	corrected low bar squat variations “prime mover” category to “quadriceps” from “glutes”. it’s still a quad focused exercise but more glute activation relative to the high bar variation.

1.0,1e1y720,TTnickname,6,Deadlifting + severely traumatic brain injury years before attempting lifting,"deadlifting

6/19/22-11/2/22 i was hospitalized due to a severely traumatic brain injury. grade 3 diffuse axonal injury. crashed my dirt bike not exercise related. 

i was unconscious for most of the time i was at 3 different hospitals. allegheny general hospital initially, upmc presbyterian, lastly upmc mercy. 

when i was hospitalized i weighed 210lbs and came home to 145lbs. most odd what i lost was muscle. i had a peg line to give me nutrients. i also received a trachea during my pneumonia. it appeared that i was going to pass. i’ve dedicated my life to fitness in june 2023. 

i started deadlifting during recovery. at first i deadlifted 100lbs and it was hard. i haven’t tried my max but i now deadlift 190 in sets of 10. my prior max was 235lbs about a month ago. 

when i got my peg line removed it was extremely painful. 

while going through all of that my fiancée chose to leave me. reason? i’m not sure 5/1/23. 

my mentality and thoughts haven’t changed. i did completely forget the accident in totality. i did forget at the time names, events, birth dates, my own age, my fiancée’s birthday, all surprises i did for her. 

don’t say sorry about her leaving i would’ve left anyways. she did a big fat total 0, zilch, nada, nothing for me during my recovery. that was why i would’ve left her. 

i even cooked, cleaned, washed dishes, cleans cats litter, vacuumed, mopped, and swept. fuck everything with her saying “it’s best for you to do for recovery”. which was partly true. during our 5 year long relationship i was the one to all of those things anyways. 

i know this was mostly a complaint. i’m not sure is that deadlifting weight is a good amount of weight or not. 

tl;dr: deadlift is 190lbs in sets of 10 with older prior max being 235lbs",neutral

my wife has some kind of issues that make it nearly impossible for her to lose fat, and she has joint and back issues that make it hard for her to do most muscle building exercises that i know of/that physical therapists have tried with her. because of that stuff, she's a lot bigger than she's comfortable with and she doesn't have much muscle anymore. 

she hates her size and has big issues with it, so she wants my help building workout routines that she, specifically, can do. so i'm finding individual exercises on instagram that work with her body and saving them to put into different workout folders.

 problem being, almost everything good that i'm finding is from people who are toned - and she can't emotionally handle seeing person after person who she sees as looking way better than she does. so she wants me to find more people that are bigger. but i can't find them, especially ones that do low impact strength and mobility exercises that work with her joint issues.

so that's what i'm looking for - i want low impact strength and mobility exercises that are effective and are taught by people who are bigger. i'd love search terms for it, but instagram channels would work too.

edit: wow, downvoted. who would have guessed that an exercise forum would be anti-overweight 🙄.

anyhow, so far i'm finding that searching something like ""plus size workout"" gets me some results. but as soon as i try to specify anything, like ""plus size pilates ball workout"" or ""plus size mobility workout"" i go right back to seeing people who don't have an ounce of fat on them.

i'm not a morning person so i've always set my exercise to after work (5pm). but no matter how light or intense the exercise is- doesn't matter if it's yoga or lifting or running or swimming- i always have problem falling asleep at night. mind you, i would feel tired (exhausted on some days or just light post-out-buzz for others) but i would not be able to fall asleep at all. it's really disheartening to me, especially since i want to take steps into living a healthier life. 

i also don't think it's the power of suggestion (like i expect to have trouble sleeping after gym so i work myself up). yesterday, i did yoga at around 5pm. and i was tossing and turning until 2am without knowing why. that woke my partner up and he mentioned that i ''never fall asleep easy on \[my\] gym day''. i haven't even realised that until he pointed it out. 

will this improve over time? or do i have to switch my workout to morning entirely? right now i feel like i'm stuck in the exercise-makes-me-insomniac-which-makes-me-tired-the-next-day-which-makes-me-not-wanting-to-exercise-more. somehow, i feel like it makes my life quality worse rather than better.

at the moment i am using a treadmill every day for 25 minutes (speed is not too fast - i am walking barefoot due to edema in my lower legs and mostly my feet, making it impossible to wear proper shoes). its at 3.3 and 3.4 miles an hour (for reference i'm 5""4). this gives me roughly 2.5k steps a day for just doing that.

i need to lose a lot of weight and i figured since every time i did diet + exercise at the same time and having lots of headaches i would give up. so instead  i focused on a regime for moving. which i have done now successfully for a month and i'm damn proud of myself! 

at the moment my main goal is to hopefully have the edema go to a point where i can fit in shoes again (been to a doctor, meds don't work etc, so i think it's just not enough movement - at home i used to use the stairs multiple times a day and in my new place i don't really since we have none. it's also to steep for me to walk here due to the hills and lack of good footwear). 

anyway! i also have a rowing machine and an elliptical and hopefully a bicycle as well in the next months.

i want to implement these as well. just a bit unsure if it's ok to row every day as i hear different things. so i was thinking of having the treadmill be a constant thing (that's a given) every day. row every other day and maybe use the elliptical on the days i'm not rowing (to still add an extra piece of exercise in there). i'm a beginner still, but i tend to build up really fast on rowing (i've done it before and within a week i went from barely lasting 1,5 minutes first day x 3 to 30 minutes in one go).

the schedule i'm thinking about would look something like this: of course this would be the end goal, as i have to buildup the time for rowing/ elliptical :). then maybe add some weights in for the days i'm not rowing, but to still have some recovery leave an extra day in there. 

would love to hear some input (i am not asking for health advice or if a workout is good or not, i was curious if this schedule would be good or not based on the things i have at home that i can do without wearing shoes).

his excuse for this: it’s “too hot” outside. it is currently the summer and, the way my schedule is, it is the most optimal for me to begin working out, running, or walking between 11 am and 1 pm. right after i stretch in the morning, and before i eat. this is the most important reason.

he thinks i’m better off doing it either 5 am or 7 pm.

i cannot at 5 am for, among other reasons, i’d only be getting 3 hours of sleep. the reason i sleep the way i do is both because of my work schedule and the fact nobody shuts up or settles down until 3 am and i’m called insane for expecting that. i cannot at 7 because it’s way too late and by then i’ve eating and am running off blood sugars, which doesn’t allow me to burn fat, adapt to being in a fat burning state, or anything. 

he thinks my body doesn’t care about timing, and thinks it will be the same result regardless of when i do it, as long as i do it today. he has the same mentality with my gym going, loves to sabatoge that too. i end up sitting around and doing jack shit until 3 pm only to get there and be told, by every one i live with, “you have 20 minutes, you should have optimized your time better”

improve/grow upper/overall chest to get rid of man boobies
tone up arms/grow them. 
lose belly fat which will come with my cardio and weight loss.

8-12 reps for 3 sets on lat pulldowns (currently at 130lbs)

5-8 reps for 10 seconds, 2 sets on pull-up negatives (i weight 165lbs)

5-8 reps for 2 sets on pendlay rows (currently at 65lbs) (just switched to this from dumbbell rows)",neutral

i also need to mention that i am worried about my lack of recovery for my chest and back. i haven’t had this problem before. can someone explain why it feels like i’m getting weaker.

1.0,1doqd6e,jedisluts,1,Advice for strength training begining,"hi everyone,
i'm looking for some advice around getting a bit more into shape and getting a bit stronger.
i'm 27 and female, 178cm tall and weigh 80 kgs. my wedding is next year and i want to slim down, and also improve my health as i generally am pretty sedentary.

the last 8 weeks i've been doing 1 to 2 strength work outs a week, and maybe 1 short cardio session on our indoor bike (or 10 minutes on our rowing machine, or some stretching yoga) which has helped and my partner has noticed i'm getting a bit more tone. i'm limited to our home workout gear (some dumbbells, pull up stand - not that i can do a pull up lol, and a long weight bar - not sure the name, and a bench).

i would love any feedback on where to take my workouts from here as i feel frustrated i'm still 80kg.

here are the three workouts i've been rotating through:

session 1:
- overhead shoulder press dumbell 5 sets × 5 (i'm up to 14kgs)
- dumbbell one arm row 5 sets × 5 (i'm up to 9kg)
- dumbell deadlifts 5 sets × 5 (i'm only doing 5kg as just added this)
- dumbbell squats 5 sets × 5 (again only just started doing squats with weights 5kgs)
- dumbbell calf raises 5 sets × 5 (16kg)

session 2:
- dumbell deadlifts 5 sets × 5 (i'm only doing 5kg as just added this)
- dumbbell squats 5 sets × 5 (again only just started doing squats with weights 5kgs)
- side lying hip abduction 3 sets
- parallel bar hip raise 3 sets × 3
- dumbbell calf raises 5 sets × 5 (16kg)

session 3:
- wall push ups 3 sets × 5
- dumbbell alternating hammer curls 5 sets × 5 (6kg)
- plank 3 sets × 20 seconds
- reverse push up in a walk corner 3 sets × 5
- dumbbell one arm row 5 sets × 5 (i'm up to 9kg)
- overhead shoulder press dumbell 5 sets × 5 (i'm up to 14kgs)

i've been calorie counting and i'm generally at 1900 - 2000 .

just to add, as i'm not sure if it's important, i've struggled with ""borderline anorexia"" in my early 20s (where i got down to 55 kgs) so i'm trying really hard to not get too obsessive which is why i've been kinda keeping ""one foot out the door"". i'm autistic so it's really easy to get tunnel vision. i also have dyspraxia so i'm extremely clumsy, so one main goal is getting a bit stronger as i've heard it helps a bit.

1.0,1dkrq3k,bluejaymewjay,9,Is spending lots of time in my top heart rate zone bad?,"brand new to this sub and pretty damn new to exercise on the whole. 26, f, was average-skinny all my life but i’ve finally lost that high teenager metabolism and i’m noticing how out of shape i am. i get out of breath doing silly things, and my body has changed shape pretty noticeably. i figure it’s time to work out, if not exactly to lose weight, then at least to maintain some semblance of fitness.

i have an apple watch and log all my workouts there. primarily i just walk outside and run on the elliptical (occasionally i mix in weights and some dance workouts, but anyway)— what i’m curious about are the heart rate zones that apple watch logs.

i just wrapped up a 54-minute elliptical exercise. i spent around 26% of my time in heart rate zone 5 (see pic). i wasn’t really actively trying to push into this zone, but i found myself creeping into zone quite a bit. when i google heart rate zones, most resources are telling me that this zone is basically “me at my limit” and that i should be spending 5% of my time there or less. but this zone doesn’t always feel like “my limit,” and my watch is showing that i’m capable of staying in it for quite a bit more than 5% of my time.

should i be actively preventing myself from spending so long in this zone? is it bad for me, or for my workouts overall? i don’t really know what i’m doing, to be honest, and i’m just curious— i’ve had several workouts like this and the question is always in my mind.  ",curiosity

i considered myself a fighter.  i don’t compete but i train judo , combat sambo (mma), and historical european martial arts (sword fighting) 1x weekly.

my morning workout routine has been m w f strength and hypertrophy.

strength:

i do 2 sets of 4 dips, 4 pushups, 4 kettlebell jump squats (40lb kettlebell) and 4 rows with a 65 lb weight 4 grip squeezes with a grip thing and 30 seconds of inverted plank with my head lower than my feet with the weighted vest on.

hypertrophy:

i do 2 sets alternating of 6 pull ups and 21 pushups with no added weight.  i then do 30 leg lifts and 30 kettle bell jump squats.

this has worked well for me.

on t and th i do cardio.  most often i jump rope for 3 sets of 5 minutes but sometimes i hit the heavy bag.

in the evenings i train martial arts.

here’s my challenge.  i’m moving from a schedule of mma 1 to 2x weekly and hema (historical european martial arts) 1x weekly to a schedule of mma 2x weekly, judo 1x weekly, and hema 1x weekly.  i try to do mma on monday and saturday, judo on thursday, hema on friday, and the other mma day can be variable.

i’m having plenty of energy for all my martial arts classes but i’m finding in my friday workout that my muscles are too tired to push hard and i struggle with a workout i’m normally pretty good with.

here’s my question, how do i space things out so that i’m giving my body enough recovery time?  am i just doing too much?  do i need to change days for something?  thursday judo, friday hema, and saturday mma are set in stone but i can play with the other mma day and my morning workout routine.  if needed, i can cut out a morning workout though i’ve gotten very strong and don’t want to lose that.

1.0,1dfsmfy,First-Bed-5918,7,Runners high advice ," i'm struggling with exercise in a way that seems to be more mental than physical. i can't seem to grasp that euphoric feeling/ runners high that people often talk about. instead, i hit a mental block whenever i start feeling achy or out of breath, making me want to give up. 

this stems from childhood trauma, leading to an irrational fear that expending energy is somehow harmful. deep down, i know this isn't true, and i'm actively working to overcome it because i understand the importance of exercise for both physical and mental health.

currently, i cycle out of necessity and swim for pleasure, but even then, i find myself battling these mental obstacles when it gets tough. i desperately want to experience that runners high and shift my perspective on exertion from negative to positive.

has anyone else experienced something similar? if so, i'd love to hear how you've managed to overcome it or if you have any advice to offer.

1.0,1deiznd,Nubian_Cavalry,7,Should I do my 24hr fast before or after working out?,"hi, i made the mistake of following my father's advice (if you do a bit of digging you may know what i am talking about) and, in combination to my lack of self control in the face of certain things i seem to have gotten back up to ~160lbs, from ~150. in less than 2 months.

i have realized a few things in hindsight. i began working out in september but my schedule was admittedly pretty crummy until late october. while i was 163, the 158-159 in january (when i had easier access to a gym) it was more muscle, as my pictures back then made me look more defined. i completely lost access to a gym by february up until april, and despite doing 100 push ups and sit ups every other day to compensate, i lost my muscle mass, which is the reason i ended up at 150 despite basically not working out. i had the same eating habits. right now, same weight, but signifigantly less muscle mass, a smooth blotch of stomach fat, basically nothing to show for it.

in short,  in april i was called a skinny, weak little boy by my father, two sisters, and younger brother (3 out of the 4 are straight obese, the 4th is sedentary unless they are on season) and they suggested i do more muscle training, eat **alot** more, stop worrying about walking everyday, eat alot more protein (a plateful of rice and chicken with vegetables isn't alot according to them), 150 sit ups, push ups, and burpees every single day, and i will be better off.

i do more muscle training, i continue to walk despite their issues, put 1-2 more pieces of chicken in my plate, add sandwich ham to it since that's all we really had. i can't promise i didnt eat more outside of my favorite meal since it's incredibly hard to stay consistent with my health when everyone is in my ear telling me i'm too obbsessed and i do too much, but i can promise you i didn't have an intention to.

a few days ago, i realize i am back to 160. i bring this up to them all in a conversation at an airport, as i dared to mention the possibility of the occasional 24hr fast to them, because they still believe i am skinny and small and soft. i do, truly feel like i eat too much sometimes, but they don't think that. ""you just eat too many carbs"" (no more than them) but at the same time ""you eat to little, you need to eat more""

they are now suggesting i focus solely on core excercises (which i already do) to burn my stomach fat, just for a month to see how i look. i am not doing that shit. instead, i will return to the routine i used to do last year, incorporate hiit every 4-5 days, and a 24 hour fast every 3 days.

which is the main thing i am here to ask about, sorry for the rant. i will eat my last meal at around 7 or 6. plan for tommorow is to fast, and then the next day, i would go to the gym doing my usual routine, then eat. i should be in ketosis by then. i will not do this everytime i go to the gym, only when the days align.

would it better for me to, instead, begin my 24 hour fast tommorow and go to the gym that morning? 

i did a 24 hour fast a few days ago to allow a laxative to do work and i felt terrible the next morning, woke up early and could not go back to sleep. i ran like 0.5 miles that morning and felt a good burn, took an hour walk, then got back to eating. so i'd just like to know if this is something i should continue on.",neutral
1.0,1deb9qr,USCDornsifeNews,1,The optimal lean for runners trying to save energy (new research),"this new study suggests runners should ‘lean into it’ — but not too much

the study looked at recreational runners who ran with different levels of forward lean, from a nearly upright posture to a maximum lean of 8 degrees. findings suggest that running with a slight forward lean of 2 to 4 degrees results in less energy demand compared to a maximum lean.

in fact, runners using a slight forward lean, similar to that typically preferred by most runners, were 8 percent more energy efficient.

the study was published may 29 online in plos one.

in the study, participants were asked to run on a treadmill at a speed of 8 miles per hour using three levels of forward postural lean (upright, maximum lean, and 50% of maximum lean) while researchers measured their oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production to calculate the amount of energy being expended.

overall, runners were 7% to 9% less energy efficient when running with their maximum forward lean than when running with a moderate lean or running upright.

“surprisingly, our results show that running with a maximum lean increases the energy cost of running in a way that is similar to adding 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of weight to your lower legs,” said justus ortega, kinesiology professor at cal poly humboldt and director of the biomechanics lab there.

the study also hints that the energy savings from moderate leaning could be linked to less demand on the hip muscles, particularly the gluteus maximus, which is more active when running with a large lean and likely requires more energy consumption.

“improving running techniques that save energy is important when it comes to maximizing performance. but perhaps more importantly, people are more inclined to stick with physical activity that requires less energy. so, results like these may be important for both improving athletic performance and promoting consistent engagement in recreational running,” said study co-author aslan, who is a member of the evolutionary biology of physical activity lab headed by david raichlen, professor of biological sciences and anthropology at usc dornsife. aslan worked on the study while a master’s degree student at cal poly humboldt.

however, anytime one of the channels i watch posts a short showing one of their weightless arm techniques the comments become flooded with people (usually from a fitness reaction channel who has criticized it) saying that these movements are useless. they won't tone your arms, they won't build muscle, all you're feeling is lactic acid, it's useless and stupid, etc. 

personally i have noticed a difference in my arms. and i'm not too bothered because my main goal is simply not to be sedentary all day at work, not to get a hardcore exercise in five minutes. but i'm really curious if it is actually ""useless"" to do things like arm circles and leg lifts because there's no weight involved?

i am naturally an introvert/quiet and can appear quite offish (apparantly) so usually no one speaks to me at events or if i go for a walk, it’s like i don’t exist. 

however if i go for a run - i usually either do a 2 mile run or intervals 800m repetitions on the busway path near where i live. people interact with me. for example in the last week - a kid ran alongside me and told me he wants to jog. 5 people have said ‘keep it up/keep going’. i was sat resting in between intervals and a woman said ‘you look how i feel’. a man said that i had done really good getting up a hill. many people smile at me. 

how come i’m not approachable when walking, at social events yet i am when running?

i don’t know what the psychology behind it is. 

if any of you want more attention or feel ignored by society- simply go for a run. or do some exercise in public.

i work a desk job and i kept seeing ads for the walking pads that you can use when you’re home working or watching tv. i ordered one from amazon… tried to do my best research to get one that was long enough for me (i’m 5’9 and have long legs). i kept feeling like i was overcompensating with quick short steps and i was straining my back. i stopped using it after 3 or 4 days because of the pain. that was maybe 3 weeks ago. the issue is i still have that back pain, and now when i stand for long periods of time the burning sensation in my lower back is so intense. has anyone else experienced this? and don’t tell me to go to a doctor please lol.

1.0,1d8ctzk,Snugsmontreal,1,Weight shift after exercise,currently stated exercising to get in shape for my birthday in 4 months and have been watching my weight pretty closely. i do this more to see what foods make me bloat or retain water than actually expecting change every day. i noticed that when i exercise if i weigh myself before and after there is typically a 1.5-2lb difference (drop) in the before and after. what's that about? does that happen to other people? ,curiosity
1.0,1d82a1o,CodNo9280,1,735 miles in June?!,"i thought this would be an interesting journey to share and something new we are trying out.

to keep this short i will add some info:
•a friend group of +/-20 people participating
•all males between ages 29-35
•all different fitness levels from 0 exercise, to multiple times per day.
•the group resides in 7 different states

rules:
1. june 1st has a goal of 10 miles. each day of june you add one mile. total for june is 735 miles. 
2. miles conversion as follows
     a. run 1 mile=log 1 mile
     b. bike 3 miles=log 1 mile 
     c. swim 0.25 miles=log 1mile
     d. walk 2 miles=log 1 mile
3. all activities must be sent into group chat to count. if it wasn’t recorded it doesn’t count.
4. there will be no rollover miles.
5. the miles only count for the day that it was recorded on. 

this is a group of friends that has known each other and stayed in contact for the better part of 20 years through childhood, higher education and now adulthood. we have fostered a very open forum of discussion with no judgement and a safe place to ask for help or guidance. 

our group decided to encourage healthy exercise and move away from unhealthy choices through group participation goals.

i will update this thread with our progress and welcome anyone to join us! ",neutral

1.0,1d7l6nh,Typical-Sink2640,9,Honey post workout,i’m a 19m and do daily high intensity weight lifting and have heard that honey post workout is good for recovery. by my understanding the glucose and fructose (which is about 50/50 ration in honey) take seperate pathways to refilling glycogen in the muscles which helps start recovery faster. is this true?,curiosity
