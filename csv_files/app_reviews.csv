"This is the second time purchasing a Fitbit. I figured if I upgraded, there would be a difference — maybe their early versions were just bad. Nope! Within 3 months, my BRAND NEW Fitbit will not charge, the band is already tearing off. Terrible quality. Spend extra$ on other products. I’m so livid!  If it was a year or two… okay. This is unacceptable! "
"I had three issues after I set up a new Inspire 2.  I called last night and was hung up on three separate times when the agent did not know the answer to my first two questions.  Once, after hangup, I received a set of instructions that were non-effective.  Dumped three times.  Today, I called three more time about the third issue regarding my free year of Premium which had not been addressed last night.  I asked the same question on each of the three calls and got three vastly different and conflicting answers!  Nowhere.  This is the status of Fitbit Customer Support.  Not worth your time."
Just 2 years and 2 months of owning my fitbit versa 2 the face fell of. The glue had failed. Customer service said  basically tough it's out of guarantee and I can have discount off a new one. This is supposedly a water proof sports watch and at that price I would expect it to be durable and last longer than 2 years 2 months.Will never use fitbit again Customer chat ie customer service is shocking
After having 2 Fitbits changed under warranty now Google has taken them over they are not quite as helpful.Don't buy a Fitbit if you want to swim in the sea with it as it appears that you cannot.This is despite Fitbit suggesting that the watch can go down to as far as 50m  in water. It does not state anywhere that this does not apply in the sea.In fact I would not be surprised if it would last that long in a swimming pool either.Note that what it does say in small print is that the water seal deteriates over time and therefore you won't get any any joy if your watch stops working after a year.After 3 watches wrecked after swimming in the sea and bringing this to their attention it rely is time that on their discription it should say cannot be worn in the sea! 
"Versa 4 stopped working. Staff not trained, no customer service, no complaints procedure and ceo never acknowledged my email. Google have process of no customer service. Won't buy another smart watch from Google or fitbit. Replacement watch has same fault."
I have a  Versa Fitbit purchased 2021 - it is working well but the flimsy plastic clasp which fastens the watchstrap to the watch has broken away - rendering the watch to useless.  The plastic clasp is clearly not designed for longevity neither can it be replaced - so buyers beware his watch is definitely not built to last - and Fitbit don't care
"I had a Fitbit Inspire 2 which you could only read in a fully darkened room. Finally got through to customer service late afternoon who asked that I go into settings on the devise whilst it was charging. This was impossible as you couldn't read the screen, so was asked to send a photo (?) in response to an email they would send. I had to go out so said I would do this in the morning, which I did at 07.30. The email said that the case was closed but could be reopened by responding to the email, which I did -twice, with no further response; so much for customer service. This was the 2nd Fitbit which I had problems with, there won't be another!"
Had a Fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. Last Fitbit also lasted 2 years. Fitbit has lost me as a customer.  There must be better products out there.  
"Do not recomend it! Disappointing Product and Customer Service!! I am deeply disappointed with the service I’ve experienced. After just six months, the product I purchased stopped working. When I reached out to customer service, despite making it clear that I do not speak Dutch, your staff continued to communicate in Dutch. This is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. I expected much better from your company."
Fitbit is definitely not worth the money. Buy any other watch. I bought my first Fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that and no replacement available. So I decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. So I bought the charge 6 November 2023. This has been the worst decision in a long time! It had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. And this forcing to use google for it really stinks. Half of the features quit working at 6 months. I wish I had not wasted my money.
I find that Fitbit is not worth the money.  They are programmed to fail.  I have the Fitbit Luxe. It just randomly shuts down.  My friend had the same issue. She recently bought a new Fitbit. It's already having problems.  I will never buy another one.  I've worn Fitbit for years.  I just don't have the money to throw away on a crap product. 
"Used to be such a great company from which we purchased multiple smart watches, but since their acquisition every single functionality of these devices has been poor. There is no new content, no new watch faces, no new apps meanwhile the competitors have all the cool stuff."
We bought a watch in early 2023. One of them was faulty since then we been chasing a replacement and have receipts with watch been sent back.its been forever and we just lost interest in chasing it with poor correspondence from fitbit as a company itself. I'm disgusted as a company and there handling. 
"I’ve been a Fitbit customer since 2012.   Until I got a new Fitbit watch for Christmas, I’ve had no problems.  Now, it is nothing but problems.  The watch will stop tracking random metrics.   It drops the Bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red X, second one works) before it can be re-linked to the phone.  I am beyond frustrated. "
"Do not purchase a Fitbit watch!!!Customer service chat very helpful but in the end not a satisfactory result. Fitbit replaced a faulty watch in August 2022, today the replacement failed due to water ingress, sitting in a 60cm deep pool. Customer service representative very polite but had to tell me the unit is out of warranty offering a 35% discount code for purchase of a new watch. I think it's better to buy from Sheen only €19 looks the same and works with many iPhone and android phone fitness apps."
"I ordered a Fitbit sense 2 off their website for my friends 30th birthday as she wanted one. The package came damaged like it has been opened so I contacted their customer service report. They told me to call dpd their delivery service which I don’t know how they would be able to help me as I bought it from Fitbit website itself. Instead of apologising or help me with any other alternatives they said they will put it in a report. I don’t want my money back and I would happily sent them back the whole thing in replace of a better box so I can present it to my friend rather than presenting it looking shabby, they just told me they can’t do anything about it. For that amount of money I expected something better as the watch itself was over £200. I’m really disappointed with their customer service and their attitude towards it all and definitely will not order from here again."
"Wrist band broke on second wearing. Control buttons poor and hard to use. Watch didn't synce in with my phone, I contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway.  Very disappointed with product"
"Used to love Fitbit but it's taken a massive dive in quality recently. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. I talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. Wouldn't buy another Fitbit device in the future."
"Horrifically poor company. My Fitbit Versa 2 began to fail after 18 months, so I contacted Fitbit customer services to seek help as the watch has a two year warranty. I’ve tried contacting Fitbit twice over the last month and nobody has bothered to acknowledge either of my emails. I tried to raise this as a formal complaint as the watch is getting progressively worse and the warranty period is running out, only to find they have no official complaints procedure. The warranty is absolutely useless if nobody is there to fix an issue when it presents. I don’t know how such an established business is allowed to operate like this with no accountability. When I inevitably have to replace this watch at my own expense, I will definitely go to a competitor who can be trusted to honour a warranty. "
"I purchased the Fitbit two months ago. It didn't charge and stop working. They asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. After hours of my time wasted, I decided to order the replacement on Amazon. The chat was long and irritating. "
Second time my fitbit charge 5 has stopped responding since purchase. First time they sent a new one with no problem but that has failed now. This time they refuse to refund and only to exchange (been down this path before) plus they want me to send mine back and wait two weeks for a replacement to be shipped. 
Well the Charge 4 has worked for four years. The only problem I’ve had is recharging. This is a fairly hit or miss operation. The straps are pretty rubbish but I’m on a second replacement elasticated version. It links well with my phone. I only use the steps function as I don’t like sharing too much personal information. I use my other watch to tell the time as it is difficult to see the Fitbit face in strong light. 
Fantastic app for monitoring my sleep and improving my wellness
"Contacted Fitbit Support on Sunday when my watch started losing charge. Through chat tried various fixes which unfortunately didn’t resolve the battery problem. They asked me to send my proof of purchase, which I did and less than 48 hours later I have a replacement device. My original device was more than 12 months old btw. All this support and the replacement was free! Absolutely delighted with their service! "
"Brand new fitbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Finally convinced the support to raise a return. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support but for this challenge you can only be helped by the call centre so hours of hold later gave up and ordered a replacement on amazon.....what a joke. This is my last fit bit which is a shame as the app is good and previous products have been much better quality. "
Awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn’t sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won’t even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty when it was working fine.can offer 30 percent off a new one I don’t want a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak Indian or Pakistani shocking 
Fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever 
My Charge 5 dies several times a day (when battery is still indicating above 70% charge). I've only had it for about a year. Before that my Charge 3 died after about 2 years' use. I think I'm not going to bother to go through a possibly pointless customer support process with them. Will probably just retire this and not buy Fitbit anymore.
"I give it 0 stars! Initially the service wasn't too bad, the strap supplied with the watch burned my wrist and they sent me a woven one. Then the charging cable broke and they sent me a new one, then my Fitbit Charge 5 broke with that software update in 2023 and they sent a replacement eventually after a month. Now this one has broken and I have been in talks with them for over 5 weeks! First they send me 35% off for American customers only, after I telling them I am in European region and I am Irish, this is no good. Since then I've been going around in circles with them. Eventually they said would replace the watch if I verify my account... the link they sent was broke! Back to contacting the chat.... now it's verified and it's wait for another e-mail... It's actually the worst customer service I ever experienced. But I'm going to keep fighting. Both watches lasted less than a year... through no fault of my own. Now I see all the other reviews for Fitbit here... I know it's not ""just a small number of customers"" as they love to say! Pure pathetic Fitbit!!! "
"I have been an avid Fitbit user since 2016.Unfortunately in 2019 Google purchased Fitbit and its Customer Support and Service is absolutely terrible and useless. I purchased a Fitbit Sense and after less than 9 months it stopped working.  I received a replacement ( which on the outer packing was marked Refurbished!). Then last November whilst on holiday the Sense Fitbit became very hot on my wrist and stopping working again. After emails and photos etc back and forth they agreed to replace it, I sent it back and heard nothing about a replacement and had a battle with their CS. Eventually after 6 weeks I received a replacement. Then in early July this year the replacement watch overheated again on my wrist and almost burnt me causing a  reddened area underneath the base of the watch. After numerous emails, photos of the device, charger and strap ( also the red area on my wrist) , it was agreed that I should return the Fitbit device . I did this with the label that they emailed to me and sent it to their warehouse in the Netherlands and tracked the package which arrived there on the 23rd July. Since then I have not had any Fitbitfrom them stating that they have received it.  When I enquired via email at Fitbit support I received the same formatted email asking me to send the faulty device back to them!!!! WHICH I HAD ALREADY DONE! Today as a last attempt I used their on line chat and requested this to be escalated. I have now been assured that I will receive a replacement in 7-10 days. I asked for a email confirming this but I’m not holding my breath!  What a shame as I loved using my Fitbit - maybe I’ll treat myself to an Apple Watch instead!! "
If I could leave no stars I would. I am on my 3rd versa 2 since 2019. I’ve had issues with my 3rd one for weeks. I emailed no response. Tried calling cannot get through to a UK call centre and the so called customer service man I spoke to literally read a script . I explained my versa stopped syncing unless I shut down completely that was 12 weeks ago. now the button is not doing anything won’t power off or do anything at all when pressed/held . After asking about my google account as they are now merged ? I was asked to turn off my watch by pressing the button. I don’t now how that in anyway is customer service. Do exactly what I stayed was the problem. I’ve had my screen stuck on set up wallet for days though have never used this. I always rated Fitbit but your Customer service people need to be trained not just read their script. I tried 8 times to get through to a uk call centre using the UK NUMBER got through to every county but uk.  I will now replace with an Apple Watch. 
"Fitbit charge 5 broke within 6 months of purchase, and instead of honouring the warranty period, they just wanted google account sign ups, and a bunch of other crap ‘tasks’ that had nothing to with a Fitbit purchase several months ago. Also borderline impossible to talk to anyone. Only method of contact is an online chat, that is offline most of the time. They wore me down to the point I just gave up on the warranty claim and repair and threw the watch out.A total scam and a crap product, will never use it again"
"Terrible product. Terrible serviceI bought my Versa 4 in March 2024 (5 months ago) to replace my previous Fitbit. I have used Fitbit products for years and have always loved their smartwatches. That was until the Versa 4. The initial one sent to me had to be replaced because it didn't work. The second watch has suffered several issues including not recording my data, inaccurate recording of my data, and not linking up between my watch and my phone. I have had to contact customer service at least five times, spending between 30mins-60mins trying to resolve the issue. I requested that they refund me because this product clearly doesn't work and hasn't been sold as advertised. I was told that they couldn't refund me because it was beyond 15 days since purchase. So, just to be clear, they acknowledge that there have been numerous issues but have declined to do anything about it. "
"would give zero stars if I could. two watches (charge 4 and 5) died right after one year of normal wear, not even exercising, or in the shower. All they offer was 35% off. JOKE. doesn't even offer servicing like apple does. I bought another watch to give them onw more chance but used a different email address instead because my first email was out of storage. I now cannot activate my 6 months premium subscription in my fibit account because the premium offer if associated by email addresses. what a joke of a tech company. customer service is utterly useless and does not treat you as a human being, only answering questions with templated script. WASTE OF MONEY. do not buy. utterly disappointed by google. Fitbit has gone way down hill after being acquired"
Charge 5 black screen. The supposed service departments gives all kind of directions but nothing works. In the end they tell you we cannot further help you. No Fitbit for me anymore
"Terrible watch, tracking doesn’t sync and when it does the steps, calories and activities all drop to nothing like you’ve not done anything! Customer service is shocking, only had my Fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. Don’t waste your money with these watches. I’ve called Fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when I do get someone, there is just no solution! "
"Been a fitbit customers for years. Recently the (pc/laptop) web browser allowing full tracking of activity/ food intake etc was withdrawn. Really useful for customers (who all pay a monthly subscription ) especially older customers. First indication was a link to the app ""prefer the old browser - click here"". Then it disappeared completely. App on phone still available bit very limited in functionaly Hundreds of complaints, lots have been shut down by fitbit moderator. Look for other products like Garmin etc. My tracker/fitness device will now be tracking the bottom of my trash can."
"Unless you're lucky then they last maximum under 2 years. I love the way they work, but they die within months of a year guarantee. I got a 2 year guarantee last time knowing it would die. It's been 18 months with my current one and it's died. I knew it would happen.They're great for fitness but they're only made to last just over a year. "
"Once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. I’ve had to get a new Fitbit every year because I’ve found they just stop working after this time. I will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money for it to stop working again after a year. "
"Poor quality product complemented by absolutely abysmal customer service!!This the second replacement required for our charge 5 within a year, reading online it’s a known fault, but customer service really complete the whole sorry experience. After dealing with the inept chatbot system we requested escalation of our problem ( believe it or not one of the largest tech companies in the world cannot transfer a complaint). We then waited over 7 days for our ‘escalated’ complaint to be completed ignored. My advice, buy anything except Fitbit!!"
"My Fitbit Luxe is about a year old and has always been unreliable. You have to wear it very loosely or it doesn’t count steps. The touch screen doesn’t work e.g you cannot turn off do not disturb, it often fails to charge and doesn’t synch unless plugged in. This is very frustrating. I contacted Fitbit customer services and was told that they couldn’t help me until I changed the email account to which my fit bit was registered to a google email account. The purpose was so they could verify my identity. I gave up and will not be buying another Fitbit despite having previously had a good experience with other Fitbit products. "
First Versa 2 Faulty and eventually replaced - Replacement lasted a few months. Neither lasted a year. Now out of the 1 year warranty - Fitbit offered 35% of RRP not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. Impossible to get my complaint escalated in their CS process. Company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- SHODDY don't buy it!!
"I contacted Fitbit in the morning as I was looking to explore some watch strap recommendations for my Versa 3 I got secondhand a couple of weeks ago. My current rubber one that came with the watch wasn’t helping my eczema and unfortunately worsening it, so I wanted to switch to something breathable and more friendly for sensitive skin. I went onto the website forums and ended up contacting the customer help chat and spoke to two lovely people named Valentina and Julian. Both were helpful and polite. I told them about my issue and wondered if they could recommend a better strap for me to get or see if there was anything more I could do with my current strap to stop irritating my skin. They amazingly ended up offering me a free woven band to replace my current one in the hopes that it will be kinder to my skin. This was so fast, so kind and really made a stressful week better. Thank you so much! "
"Purchased fitbit sense 2 back in March. It suddenly completely stopped working! No charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. Raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. Just ridiculous. I should have checked Trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by Google. Big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? Never seen this before!Not purchasing this again, Will opt for better well built competitors and will advise the same to family and friends."
"I had previously contacted them to arrange a warranty repair. I was asked to pay for my own shipping materials, despite the wording of the warranty saying I would not have to pay.I did also not feel that the suggestion to return an item with a li-ion battery in an envelope or small parcel was safe. Especially given that I'm asking for a warranty replacement because the watch is not working for an unknown reason. Who knows if that battery is safe still....They asked for feedback , I gave direct feedback that I felt they where not following their warranty terms and trying to make me pay for part of the return.I have not had any response from them regarding this. I still have a broken Fitbit as I refuse to pay when I should be covered under the warranty. I would not buy a Fitbit or recommend it to anyone given the repeated failures of device and terrible quality of customer service "
"such a bad quality, designed to fail the day after the guarantee expires.I liked Fitbit fitness trackers at the beginning; the entire family used them. We are not fitness freaks to use them intensively and we are not swimming or showering with the devices. They have an easy life with us and we maintain them well. It is not the usage that caused the below failures. Here is the story of the devices we owned:Fitbit Charge 3 - after warranty expired the screen lost its brightness, impossible to use, simply too dark and no way to configure/change that. Fitbit Versa 3 - the contacts on the back of the watch  wore out so the contact with the charger cannot be made and the watch would not charge. just shortly after it went out of warranty. Normal usage, just plugging the charger when it needed a charge and in two years the metal from the contacts was gone. Fitbit Charge 5 #1 - after 10 months the sensors on the back started to go crazy, burned my hand. The battery at 100% would last for minutes only and the whole thing would be burning hot. Device replaced promptly by Google. Nine months later the replacement device breaks, a piece comes apart (bad glue I guess) and the device keeps crashing and not recording anything. Google is currently replacing it - this is the only device left in use but warranty expires in 2 months.... Fitbit Charge 5 #2 - after 1.5 years the screen goes pink, device crashes often and becomes unusable. Google promptly replaces it. After 10 months the replacement device stops recording the pulse, steps, etc. battery gets from 100% to 0% in 4-5 hours. Support is asking me to disable everything (notifications, spO2, everything that could consume battery). Device still broken; just 1 month out of warranty so no replacement this time. Generously Google support is offering me a 35% discount on their shop for a new device. On their shop where the price of a Charge 5 is 35% more than on amazon, LOL. To be correct, the netto difference between Google shop with 35% discount and amazon would be precisely 6.5EUR in my favour. But no thank you, I pass this time.We also owned a Charge 4 but I do not remember when we had to throw it to the bin and why. The support is prompt and professional, but they are limited by their script. Thanks to those people that do their job.Conclusions:- low quality, incredible failure rate. - never again buying a fitbit, I've had enough"
Love my fitbit when it works.Had various fitbits over the years with most recent being a sense but each one dies with approx a year.Initially I just kept buying replacements then when new sense died within few months I contacted fitbit who helpfully sent refurbished replacement. However 9 months later & this is completely died....it charges but then screen goes off/blue line before charge us 0% again within 1hr. Tried extensively trouble shooting it myself over few days but no luck so contacted fitbit. They helpfully tried to trouble shoot (same stuff id done but I re-tried anyway). No luck do offered  discount.....basically costs me £143 for new sense 2.Asked about repair or replacement/buy of my current model of fitbit sense (as don't wish or need newer model & can't afford £143 only 9 months after for new fitbit). No offer.I do love my fitbit but this is twice its broken within less than 1 yr each time. Doesn't seem sustainable so will be looking into alternative brands now  :( 
"Google beancounters ruining what was once a good fitness tracker. The latest insult is the idea that a tiny mobile screen is a replacement for a big screen, or the app touch display is a replacement for a keyboard mouse. Only if you have unlimited time available.Going to Garmin now after more than 10 years with fitbit."
I love Fitbit and am obsessed with my watch. Over the past 4 years my Fitbit has stopped working twice and both times they ask me to send it back and have sent me a brand new one! Not many companies would do that so I think it’s great. It was so quick as well having sent the broken one on Wednesday (all the way to the Netherlands from the UK) and I had brand new one arrive by the Saturday! I generally find it so great for tracking all my exercise too and there’s so much you can do on the app. I would never move to any other watch and always recommend them.
"I spent a week explaining to them that my Charge 5 Fitbit device stopped working. After sending them a video as a proof, they promissed to come back to me with a solution. Another week and two reminders later they are silent, although my device is still covered by their warranty! It seems to me they are behaving as if they are the only company providing this service on the market. I won't be buying anything from them and don't recommend it to you to buy anything from them either, unless you want to throw away your money!"
"I have had several Fitbit’s over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product.The latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .Attempted to contact Fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply.Shoddy product much better and cheaper replacement from other Companies.Case ID 2-8466000036794"
"Having used Fitbits of various types for about 10 years I am now walking away. 4 x Charge 3s replaced, thanks to paying for the enhanced protection from Currys. Upgraded to Versa 3. Now have a Versa 3 graveyard on my desk thanks to all 3 of them losing their cover. It literally just fell off and the screen is hanging there. 1st one was replaced by them as in the 1 year warranty (which says a lot about their own faith in their products) 2nd one was outside the warranty period and so they gave me a 'goodwill' 30% off voucher, 3rd one shuffled off 2 weeks out of warranty and have had zero response to my communication with them. Aside from the extra cost, the sheer hassle of communicating with them has taken up too much of my time. If Garmin etc is out of your price bracket, go for the myriad of cheap ones. Don't waste time or money on this failed product.PS the recent 5 star reviews saying how great the customer service is makes me wonder. They are definitely out of kilter with the experience of most on here."
"I’ve been a Fitbit customer for years & although their products don’t last forever, you can get them for a decent price & they are great when fully working. On top of that, their customer service was great & very quick & easy to access, with replacement watches being sent out efficiently & being received the next day. Since Google have taken over, EVERYTHING about their customer service is infuriating! Contacting them is  extremely hard & once you get in contact with them, you have to jump through hoops to get anything from them! Their webpages and their emails are like something from the 1990’s. At EVERY step of my complaint, I have been extremely concerned that I am being scammed, as their webpages & emails are so unprofessional. Their processes for returning a faulty item are ancient, especially in this day & age, and especially for Google! I do not have any confidence that I will be sent a replacement item, & I am very much expecting to be scammed by this, somewhere along the way. I will NEVER be buying a Fitbit item again! "
I've been a Fitbit user for 2 years and also was surprised by the sleep screen changes. However you can make it work for you and get the numbers changed if it ignores the first or last hour of the sleep pattern.Not sure what other reviewers feel they are missing?
"Fitbit, which was purchased by google, just stopped supporting their website and forcing long-time users to use a silly phone app. Like myself, Fitbit users have been loyal because of the health, sleep, food and exercise data that the website has displayed since the company's inception. This information is not available on the silly app and what is there, is summarized on a tiny phone screen. It looks like screwgoogle has decided to stop the web support to kill Fitbit in favor of their trackers and some future (not release yet) AI data analyzer. We wouldn't need AI if we could just look at our data. As a 9+ year happy Fitbit user, I would not recommend Fitbit and suggest people look at Garmin."
"I have never had such poor customer service my wife’s Fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an Apple Watch "
What a waste of money. Charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. Goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. I will not purchase another fitbit as changes since Google took over are rubbish anyway
If I could give minus 10 I would. Longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. Will never use again. Customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence. 
"I'm now have a charge 6I like it but unfortunately it never picks up the stairs even if I'm walking up 8 floors. The smaller strap is shorter than it used to be. Only had it a couple of weeks but seems OK so far. Magnetic charger with this one. The app is OK but the food part is a bit naff, scan your wrappers and it's something completely different lol. Charge 4 lasted 2 year, the plastic connection bit on the side of the fitbit that clips onto your strap snapped off. After 9 month this stopped notifying me to move, it wouldn't notifying me of hitting 10,000 steps. Battery only lasted 3 days and I never used the GPS function. I did contact customer service after a year as the strap snapped and they did replace it immediately for free. Charge 2 stopped working after 2 year also. To be fair, I don't mind updating my watch after 2 year but I'd like to do it on my terms and not because it's broken. "
"As much use as a chocolate tea-pot now !Like many others, I've been a fitbit customers for years. Now the (pc/laptop) web browser allowing full tracking of activity/ food intake has been withdrawn. It WAS really useful and FAR easier to use than trying to squint at your phone. Now it is next to useless and over 5 years of data I entered is next to impossible to use.Unless they reinstate the desktop, my FitBit is going in the bin & I am never buying another one of their products again. I advise you do likewise !"
"Was great, really enjoyed the watch and the app, but the latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is MUCH MUCH harder to read and I no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. I've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. Really disappointing."
The charge 5 is ok for its price.  The display is vibrant and much easy to see in sun that the charge 4However some annoyances 1). Presumably from inadvertent touch screen touches particularly in shower as it can’t cope with water at all  it sets its self to exercise modes and then over inflates everything Eg today I have moved from my desk but after 2 hours notice it thinks I am doing weights and has vastly inflated the activity score etc2) the gps is poor 3).It locks up reasonably frequently and sometimes requires reset mostly you wait a bit and it frees up again but annoying as you can see time whilsti it’s locked 3) I am on my 3rd new device as they just stopped working. Fitbit changed free of chargeafter 2 hours of diagnosing 
"Would give them 0 stars if I could - don't purchase. The versa 4 is so glitchy. It doesn't track properly, the battery life is super short, the screen display disappears. Fitbit won't event talk to me as I don't have a Google email account. £200 down the drain. "
"If I could give zero stars I would!On a recent holiday, after checking my charge 4 was waterproof (up to 50m they say) I wore it in the pool. After 15 mins or died completely.I have contacted Fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! Not good. They also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! Very poor customer service "
I've been a Fitbit customer for years and have always been really happy but since this merger with Google their customer service has really gone downhill. My fitbit has just broken but is within warranty. Last time this happened I just got on to customer services and they sorted me a new one before the end of the day. This morning I've spent 2 hours on customer services unable to verify my account because it's not with registered with google. The person kept telling me it was my fault and there was nothing they could do. Not sure what to do now and Fitbit don't seem interested in trying to help or retain me as a customer.
"My Versa 3 suddenly caused a red, painful burn under the watch, which has now scarred. I have contacted customer support who seem to be engaging in cynical avoidance tactics of trying to blame the charging power source or some other nonsense. The internet is full of complaints of this kind. Two months later I have a scar and will be making a formal complaint. Never, ever again."
Please stay clear of Fitbit. I’ve been a loyal customer for almost 10 years and had an issue with a device I purchased. The Fitbit ‘support’ team are not interested in helping and even after my case was escalated to a manager I’ve had no response for 3 weeks since I was asked to provide my order number. Spoke to a manager over the phone and he wasn’t helpful or apologetic and just told me to speak to Google who have now acquired Fitbit. 
"I have been a Loyal Fitbit user for 10+ years and Premium Subscriber for many years since I've had my Sense Fitbit (I've had 3 previous Fitbits).  That has now all changed with Fitbit/Googles decision to shut down the Website Dashboard!!  Being forced to only use our phones to find our Fitbit information is a giant step backwards....we don't want to rely on such small screens to navigate our information, let alone try to type in items.  Seniors especially will find this very difficult, I'm one of them!!!  Fitbit/Google are not listening to their own Community as thousand of Loyal users are speaking out against this move, we are not hearing anything in return (that I've seen).  Looks to be time to put my money into another company......but very sad to give up my well loved and used Fitbit!!  Google Killed It .....I'm extremely disappointed."
"Have been a Fitbit customer since it was a clip on for your waist band! Fitbit 5 charge 2 just died last week , have phoned and emailed and tried to “ chat” they are fekking useless since Google ruined it! My 2 daughters and a couple of friends started using Fitbit years ago because I talked them up so much! Now I cannot get so much as a return label for my faulty Fitbit! After 13 years I need to change brands "
I was given a Charge 6 In March as a birthday gift and it stopped working . I spoke to Customer Service (Jose) who assured me a  replacement would be sent to me . I was then told they would not replace it but arrange a refund . Two weeks later nothing heard. I have chased them using the  case reference number and no response. I think they are unethical as it  is under warranty and therefore bother product quality and ethics as a corporation are not to be trusted 
"I have a Fitbit versa 3. It is literally the worst health and lifestyle watch in the history of mankind. Battery shocking. The GPS, oh my god. There are no words to describe how bad it is. For example, I ran with a friend, 9.02km to be precise. He tracked it on a Garmin Forerunner 55. My watch had me down as running 6.89km. I cross checked it with Ordnance Survey maps online, yep you guessed it, the Garmin was accurate to within 10 metres. The versa 3 loses GPS signal in the countryside, in built up areas, in residential areas, basically everywhere. It then uses some ridiculous algorithm to work out what you've done whilst the signal was lost. The funniest one I've encountered is me running roughly 400m with no signal, then once signal returned id gained just 20m on the watch. Pathetic. Do not buy. "
"The Sense 2 does not work. My heart rate isnt accurate on the fitbit when i compare it to any of my gym machines readingsMy step counter isnt correct. even when i am charging it. and not using, it thinks i have done numerous steps.I had 6 months of free premium subscription, and  have tried to cancel it numerous time using fitbit instrctions.I have contacted fitbit reps and they were unable to cancel the subscription since they could not see itI contacted Google and they are not helpingBut they are still charging me for the premium app, even though I cant cancelthe watch does not work, the app does not work and unable to cancel premium app subscriptionWould not recommend to anyone"
Is it possible to give Zero stars or negative stars??? Have been with Fitbit since 2015. Can't wait to leave. The final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now EVERYTHING has to be done on the mobile app. This is a disaster...as MANY people are irate. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. Plus the mobile app has many fewer features than the desktop app. This is a blatant money grab by Google. Shame on them!
"Awful, dishonest company. I bought the Fitbit Ionic a few years ago and due to safety concerns (causing severe burns to users) it has been recalled. They have disabled the watch so I can no longer use it but months later I still don’t have a refund. I have phoned and emailed multiple times without success and have started legal action against them in the small claims court as I realise they have no intention of paying me. There have been countless newspaper reports from people all over the world in the same situation and even Facebook support groups. This is not an oversight, this is a deliberate strategy by Fitbit not to pay. I’m surprised that a company as big as Fitbit are treating their customers with such distain. "
"I am on my 3rd device.  While there have been some improvements, the quality of the devices continue to suffer.  NOW they decided unilaterally to discontinue the progress view on the website and the dashboard has been disabled.  HORRIBLE COMPANY, they do not listen to their customers. I tried to complain about this situation and got nothing but a scripted response on why they did what they did - their unilateral decision ignoring customer feedback.  I will invest in something else. If you are looking for a device, look elsewhere."
"Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage.  Fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. Terrible quality, poor company, buy something else."
"Fitbit think very carefully before buying a watch from them. Mine malfunctioned within a year and their process to get an exchange is ludicrously incompetent. First of all so far it's taken 5 contacts with customer services who every time you contact need the same countless information even though you have a case already open. Then they fob you off on another team so more waiting, whose sole purpose is to send you a return label. Each time they also get the information wrong so they have to cancel the RMA and issue another, they also each time need a photo of receipt address details and serial number, which they get wrong yet again so you then have to play the same game again by going back via customer services as one department doesn't seem to talk to the other. I've still not had a correct address label and we are over a month in. Now I hear today that they will not send a new replacement either only some refurbished piece of rubbish that has been previously owned and only literally the watch, so please do not send the charger or strap back otherwise you will be in trouble. There is absolutely no way to make an official complaint via a complaint department and the chances of them actually paying attention other than the script they have in front of them is pretty much absolutely zero. I will never buy another Fitbit watch after this episode and I urge other people to think twice before they do too. It's been a traumatic time and I'm still left with a duff watch"
"As you know, I have one of your watches. I've had more than ordinary challenges with it, and generally think it's really poor quality. A few days ago I tried wearing it in the water for the first time - and then it completely broke/fell apart 🙁 (I would love to send pictures)."
Bought Charge 6 10 months ago. Rubbish loses steps data etc this is my third Fitbit. Never again. Apple for me now 
Dealing with Customer Services is a surreal experience. I am too traumatized to go into detail. My advice is to steer clear of this company. A Trustscore of 1 out of 5 should tell you all you need to know
"An expensive bit of kit, which has been reliable for the two years I have owned it. My really big concern is having spent a lot of money on its initial purchase to really benefit you have to then pay to use all the functions within the app. Knowing what I know now in no way, shape or form would buy another Fitbit. Realistically at its purchase the complete and full app should come with it all included in the purchase price. "
"It’s a shame that they charge you a subscription to use the app.  I do check mine regularly throughout the day, so I feel I have no other choice.  The Charge 6 is my current watch with them.  Good battery life, but now it’s linked to Google, I do feel restricted."
"Stopped working after 9 months. Google support is awful, completely ignore conversation. At this point, the product should qualify as a scam."
"In the past I would have given Fitbit a 4.  I have been a user for a few years and enjoyed the features. They recently removed the browser version - it is now only an app.  I am extremely disappointed as visually an app does not work for me.  I cannot see well enough to use a little phone screen.  I had years of data and custom foods etc.  Now I am left with a crappy watch?  I don't believe they care about customer service whatsoever - there are a lot of complaints, but Google is not responding to any of them.  We are invisible."
"Fitbit Charge 4 has failed when less than 2 years old, customer service not interested in the slightest and refused to do anything about it, device not fit for purpose.DO NOT ENTERTAIN BUYING ANY PRODUCT FROM THIS COMPANY"
"Don’t get a charge 5!!!Bought Fitbit charge 5 in Jan 24, but it stopped working. Battery didn’t charge. Got a replacement, a refurbished one and in June 24 the second Fitbit charge 5 has the same problem. Fitbit keeps saying they will send an email to solve the problem, but nothing.They can’t even confirm to send a new one or if they will include a charger.Charge 5 are always defective in my experience!!!"
"I have had a fitbit for many years - several Charges and then various Senses. This week, Fitbit removed that online dashboard that had lots of our data and which made finding it pretty easy.  Now they only have the smart phone app and its wildly reduced data and funtionality.   Good luck if you have weak eyesight or clumsy fingers.  Good luck if you wanted to correct your data (bc the trackers regularly miss steps...). You can't do that any more.  Good luck if you want to look at your data for specific info that you could see on the online dashboard.  That's all gone now.  I am looking at other trackers and saying good-bye to FitBit. Check out the Twitter discussion about this (search for ""FitBit""). Check out the Community comments on the FitBit website. Lots of anger. "
"I liked my Charge 4 and after a year decided to upgrade to a Versa 4 for the extra features.  After 15 months it has just died - at 8 pm last night, for no obvious reason:  last synched data shows 85% charge, but now the screen is blank and it just vibrates when I press the button or put it on charge.  Tried to swap back to the old Charge 4 and it did exactly the same thing....  Googling suggests lots of people have had the same experience and these devices rarely last more than 18 months.  I was already irritated by the Google software updates which often caused problems even when it was working.  Will not buy Fitbit again."
Was given premium when I replaced broken Fitbit. It is now due to expire and I am unable to cancel. Spent forty minutes on phone. I need to move Fitbit to Google to cancel. Absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. 
Bought my daughter a Fitbit ace 3. Stopped working within 4months. No replacement and service support not able to even get past verification. Very poor. I do not advise using this company. 
"I bought a Charge 5 after my Inspire HR of four years died. My Fitbit Charge 5 was great for about 6 months. One day it died and would not charge. Customer service was quick to respond and sent a replacement on warranty which arrived quickly. I was happy. About 9 months later the same thing happened where it died and would not charge. I reached out to customer service and they told me that because it was past the warranty phase of 13 months they could not send me a replacement. Keep in mind, the watch that stopped working was the one they sent me 9 months prior to replace the other one that did not work. When the watches worked they were great. I loved the features they came with, they were very durable and comfortable to wear, but neither lasted more than a year. I’m very disappointed that when they sent me an apparently faulty product that lasted less than a years they wouldn’t do anything about it because I had bought the original 15 months ago. The dying and never charging seems to be a common issue with the charge 5. Other reviewers say they did not last long either. Maybe some of their other trackers would be better, but after being given a second crappy watch on warranty I won’t be buying another Fitbit. Saving my money up for a Garmin, which seem to last a lot longer, and in the meantime I’m going back to my old analogue watch. "
"I initially loved the Fitbit versa watches but will not purchase again after having 2 watches.  They break within a year and are of poor quality.  Customer services were very unhelpful and they don't have a customer complaint route! Will not be purchasing again and think if they are going to be sold, it should be made clear that there is a short lifespan with a product that is not the cheapest on the market."
"Upgraded my charge 2 to a charge 5 as it has a longer battery and is water proof.WRONG! Swimming a few lengths in a normal pool and ended up with 2 replacements. So stopped using it in water at all.Then all of sudden not holding charge and now won’t turn on. They do not start a new warranty with a new product. So although I havnt had the replacement long at all, I’m now over the time frame for a replacement. I’ve had a Fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid.Very very annoyed. All they do is offer you 30% of a new one. The more people that stop giving them their money the better! "
"Been using the Fitbit charge 5 for a few months now, chose it as it was the cheaper option compared to Apple/garmin. Wish I’d spent the extra money. Fitbit data isn’t accurate, it’ll say I’ve done 100 steps as I wake up from being asleep 8 hours, and comparing it to Strava the data is completely different. My main issue is it doesn’t display a heart rate graph after any exercise, which is does for other people’s devices. Fitbit have told me for 2 months they’re working to fix the issue, dismissing me every time. I’m not allowed a refund, although the device is likely to be defective. Haven’t been very helpful at all and keep saying they’ll email me - never do. Do not recommend, very frustrating experience and not worth the money when the data isn’t accurate and doesn’t display the one thing I want it to. "
"After years of being very happy with my Fitbit tracker, not only because I was able to lose 60 lbs, by utilizing the desktop version rather than the phone app to track my exercise but more importantly to make sure I was only eating the specific amount of calories that I could consume with every meal.  I was able to create at least 50 meals that had all the micro and macro information for everything I ate.  Now that Google has taken over Fitbit they recently, July 8, 2024 took the desktop version offline. So, all my meals and other foods has to be managed on my phone which quite honestly is EXTREMLY inconvenient and laborious.  The community bulletin board on Fitbit.com has already compiled over 85 pages of complaints and there has been no response to any of our concerns from Google. I am VERY disappointed with not only there decision to allow only app access, but that they have not replied to one of the hundreds and hundreds of negative comments. When my Fitbit finally ends it's lifecycle I will not be purchasing another tracker from Fitbit.  And I am contemplating discontinuing my use of Google/Chrome as my preferred search engine and browser to Microsoft Edge. "
"I was after reliable sport trucker, Twice and 20 months, I had to have my watch replaced by Fitbit due to software issues. I wouldn’t mind it if you didn’t need me driving halfway across the city to to drop the faulty watch. by the second time I just gave up and decided to go with another brand"
My Fitbit was not giving a correct report and missing 1 or 2 days which I trained so I contacted the helpline case number 51889640 and I do not have the other case number but they could not solve the problem and they agreed to look into this and contact me and nearly 6 months later I have not heard from them. I would not buy a Fitbit product again as the after sales is very poor.
"Bought a Versa 2 in 2022 and a year and a half later had to contact them to get a replacement as the button stopped working, essentially bricking the entire watch.Eight months later and now a few months out of warranty the replacement has also developed the same fault. Now off to buy another one from another brand as this level of poor build quality is unacceptable.I have bought these for years and am devastated by the way this company has gone."
"I had a fit bit luxe. Two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. Their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. It is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. As far as I see it , it is a self perpetuating business.Sell you a product that does not last so they can get you to buy another. My money will be spent elsewhere. Shame on fit bit for putting out such a piece of junk. "
I won't be purchasing from yous again not very good customer service. Won't be recommending that my friends are family should purchase from yous!
"I have bought 3 fitbit in total, a charge 3, a charge 6 and a sense 2. I lost the two charges swimming in the lake. The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. Regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. I got 3 replacements for the sense 2 and all of them had the same problem!The strap quality and design is really bad and therefore I recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. It is a pity as I liked the interface and the app."
"If I could score them less than 1 I would. Trying to sort an issue with your Fitbit is like trying to contact the kind and queen. Ridiculous. I'm 10 days in with an issue and NO resolution just a stupid generic email. So I have a faulty Fitbit still in warranty and not one person @ Fitbit is being remotely helpful in getting this resolved. Would I recommend, Absolutely not. "
"18 months and it's toast! Syncing the device has always been problematic. Now,18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. It's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. For what it is, it's way too expensive. Should be a $19.95 late night special!"
"I bought a Fitbit 6 in February this year. In June, the heart rate sensor stopped working. It currently only function as a pedometer. I have contacted the company and I am still waiting to hear back from them. They do not care about their customers. They think they are too big to fail! Please Avoid!"
"Fitbit Sense 3. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issue. I don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. Very poor and has longevity issues. Will never buy another "
"Awful product even worse service. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. Since then I have not been able to sync the device. Clearly been blocked by staff as a result. Just about tells the time accurately, that’s it "
Rubbish app and interface. Never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. Bought a fitbit to track sleep and yoga exercises as unit is much smaller than my Garmin Fenix 7x Pro. Fitbit is better suited to a Xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. Total waste of money. Destined for the bin!
I have been using Fitbit for years and I have now had two Fitbits that broke as soon as they came in contact with water despite being advertised as a swimming tracker. This time my Fitbit was out of warranty so they only gave me a 35% off voucher for a new one. The entire Fitbit experience has also gone downhill since becoming a part of google. The customer support is atrocious. Also heart rate tracker isn’t accurate when doing exercise. I do not recommend but if you do buy one make sure to wear it while swimming within the first 2 years of owning it so that you will be able to get a replacement while within the warranty.
"Products are junk.I've had four of them, two I bought myself (Charge 4) and two that I got via work as recognition (Charge 4, Charge 5).   They last about a year and then they crap out.  In the case of the Charge 4s, they refuse to charge.  In the case of my current Charge 5 the screen swipe just goes out.They are apparently designed to last just past the one year warranty period and then crap out.  Get hold of FitBit 'customer service' and you MIGHT be given a discount on a new FitBit IF you bought it from FitBit.  If not, you're just SoL.  One star for the app/tracking.   I'm done with FitBit.   "
Started running in January. It used to show my run gps info. In February it stopped working and I contacted Fitbit. They palmed me off for months saying it was under review. I kept asking and kept being told the same thing or ignored. Eventually they asked me to sync it which 1. Is common sense and 2. I do anyway. Didn’t work. Still doesn’t work. Fitbit aren’t interested in helping. Once this gives up the ghost I won’t be returning to Fitbit. 
"I bought a fitbit sense and in less than a year it stopped working. I was sent a replacement and the same thing happened again,within the next year. I was sent another replacement. This happened for the 3rd time. The battery power lasts less than 24 hours. I spoke with customer service, via online chat and was told that they would look into it. I was then notified that I am out of warranty. I checked, it appears to be by a month. I asked how long they last and was told 2-5 years which is clearly not the case.Fitbit have offered 35% off a new fitbit. What would be the incentive to buy one,  especially as it appears that they last under a year to 13 months. Which is totally unacceptable. "
"Zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. Ive only had it two days and I'm taking it back. Worst thing is I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first. You live and learn"
They pulled the rug by discontinuing the web-based dashboard app. In my opinion a core part of the product's functionality.
Broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out yo under warranty. Replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them 
Fitbit 4 can’t even tell the difference between a 25m pool and a 50m pool - my advice is to get a proper sports watch.
"I’ve been using Fitbit watches for 8 years, mainly to track my sleep patterns, but for step count and exercise too. The program was ok until the recent upgrade, which was really a downgrade! The graphics are hard to read and give LESS information than the previous edition of the app. I’m never buying another Fitbit. I will definitely be purchasing an Apple instead. Google ruined the program!!! "
"Honestly I feel fitbit, or should I say google is trying to drive their customers away. Once my free trial of premium is up I'm switching providers. Since Google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more, the last one was the worst, fitbit is now garbage. I do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. It was bad enough that it seems you need to replace your fitbit shortly after every year, they always fail shortly after warranty. "
"Absolute garbage. Products, app, company, all trash. It is not a fitness tracking service or product, rather a biometric harvesting app. BEWARE AND DO NOT BUY OR USE FITBIT PRODUCTS."
"Long time Fitbit user.  I upgraded to Versa 4 and have had nothing but problems.  Inaccurate data, poor GPS connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support.  I have had to replace it twice and have no confidence that it will improve.  Still waiting for 2nd replacement to be processed although they received the return nearly a week ago.  Don't waste your money.  There are better trackers on the market."
Fitbit doesn't allow Amex UK contactless pay even with the latest Google Wallet replacement to Fitbit Pay. That's one of many issues.  Another that's annoying is the watch doesn't update the roaming country time until Fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. Not recommended at all. 
"I have been a FitBit user for 3-years now. Today my Versa 3 decided to start faulting, I've kept this watch well and had no previous issues.I strongly believe FitBit do not make these watches to last and would discourage anyone to make a purchase. When you pay £150+ for a watch you'd expect it to last a bit longer.Customer service offered a 35% discount code - didn't even offer the option of repair or checking for faults."
The reviews on here speak for themselves!An utter disgrace of a company! Happy to take customers money but ignore emails when products become faulty.I'm still trying to resolve an issue regarding a faulty product from April 2020. A subsequent purchase also became faulty in 2022. A replacement was sent and this 'refurbished' product has also become faulty. Various family and friends have had similiar issues with Fitbit product and the one thing they all have in common is the faults develop within a few weeks off the 'warranty' expiring so fitbit dont want to know. Send you a discount code for money off a new product to then repeat the same cycle over and over!Where does this shocking customer service end? Clearly Fitbit also dont respond to customers on here either and people like myself will go elsewhere for fitness trackers!Disgusting way to treat customers!
In a million years I'd recommend fitbit luxe. It's the worst fit tracker one could look for with even the worst technical customer support ! Don't buy it at any chsnces!! My fitbit Luxe crashes on its own with the battery of 50% full. It doesn't even send any warnings. It just goes blank. It's all started after the software update. Resetting & restarting doesn't solve the issue. It is waste of any money !!
"Every Fitbit dies after 24 months, which matches their warranty. Not a coincidence having had 5 over last 10 years due to poor battery. Now that their friends has disappeared I have finally thown in the towel, and gone for another brand. No more 2 year health watches. Total rip off if you invest in premium as it's barley the basic service from 6 years ago when it was free. "
"Have previously been so impressed by Fitbit customer service.  However with the take over from google the returns process is as archaic and fundamentally not in touch with today’s world. Trying to return the Fitbit as under warranty involves printing off a trees worth of paper in consignment notes etc, then you can’t book the pick up online, you have to go on hold to the courier company selected by Google within Australia, nearly an hour later someone picks up and agrees you can’t do this online and they book you a pick up slot.  However That window at your home address is between 9am and 5pm and you have to be home as they won’t just pick it up ! What a joke. Plus they want your drivers licence as ID - it really smacks of, if we make this so hard, then no one will ever return anything. It was also suggested I drive it to the Airport about an hour away, and 2 toll roads so I don’t have to wait in. This is the last time I will ever buy google item if this is the Australian support at the other end. "
"I was paid money to wear this thing for a year and I just can't stand it. I'm returning the money, and beating this thing with a hammer until my heartrate returns to a comfortable pace.This device insists on demanding my attention. There is no way to turn off the vibrating notifications fully - it will never be a quiet assistant, returning data for me to use conveniently. In fact, it ~must~ buzz when I'm stressed out and my heart rate is up, to let me know ""You're earning!"" - earning what? I don't give a [expletive] about your metrics, I just want my data. The app is [expletive], and data doesn't upload unless I rest the device on my phone directly, and I can't easily use it myself from there. "
It's only designed to sell you something!!  It is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works---this is the worst product ever--they try to get you to buy watch faces and pay subscriptions to access other options--run away from this.....software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap.
"had 5 fitbits, 3 of which were replacements, but each time, the watch (first fitbit Alto, then fitbit Versa 2) would not last more than 1.5 years. In 2 cases less than 1 year.  Fitbit's answer is for you to keep buying their watches for a discounted price.  They don't stand by their product enough to give you a free one.  Will not buy another fitbit device ever again! "
"I only wish I'd read the reviews years ago as I certainly would've avoided this company. Absolutely terrible customer service.My Fitbit stopped working, customer service was useless and just offered me discount on a new purchase. As if I'm going to spend money on another Fitbit. When I asked how to make a complaint they went from replying promptly to completely ignoring me. I've now asked several times over the course of a couple of weeks and been ignored each time. Upon investigating it seems others have exactly the same problem.Avoid at all costs, there are plenty of other fitness trackers. "
"I have been a long time user of Fitbit products for more than 10 years now, and I have owned my Inspire 2 for a couple of years. But more and more frequently synchronizing the tracker on the app has become a chore: it doesn't work and there's no error message.So, I have often to re-pair the device (which can take hours of trial and error) and it really appears that there are numerous backend issues after authentication so it's a couple of hours waiting for ""Connecting to Fitbit..."" to go away.It's my last fitbit product for sure. "
"I don't know what has happened to FITBIT, I have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. They have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. Any drive for customer service has completely disappeared.This is a shame as fitbit is the product that we use for all our healthcare and everything but even with that in mind they have lost this business.  "
"I have now gone through 4 fitbits , they have all broken off clips that hold the strap .My Husband has had the same problem .  Surley they should have resolved this problem by now.Will look for a better make . "
"I’ve been using Fitbit watches for over 10 years, mainly to track my sleep patterns, but for step count etc. too. I’ve mostly been satisfied with them and with the app. However, they recently “upgraded” their app and now it’s awful. The graphics look like something from 20 years ago, they’re hard to read and give LESS information than the previous edition of the app. I’m never buying another Fitbit, it will likely be Apple instead. Fitbit are treating their customers like we’re morons - well guess what Fitbit? We’re not! Goodbye and good riddance."
"I loved my Fitbit Luxe when I first had it and it worked perfectly. It’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when I was exercising,  so it’s absolutely useless to me as it doesn’t track anything and is not fit for purpose. It gives me completely random battery life percentages so I have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. I won’t be buying another one as I can’t rely on it which is a shame as I prefer the appearance of the Fitbit compared to other larger style trackers. I have tried all the tricks to try and get it working but to no avail. "
"Bought a Charge 5 for my husband’s birthday which stopped holding a charge after less than 9 months.I originally contacted the seller TradeINN (see separate review) but all they would do was send me a link to Fitbit. After trying a lengthy list of fixes they suggested, I finally managed to speak to customer services who refused to help because they said there was no record of the watch, despite it being linked to the phone and email they had been contacting me weekly about my stats …….which came from the watch they said didn’t exist!! Don’t bother with this company - they’re watches are junk and their customer service worse than useless - unless you need your blood pressure raised!"
"I have been a loyal customer for 10+ years however I will now be switching elsewhere. In April 2024 I brought a Versa 4 after much debating. 4 weeks later it’s broken will not charge, screen is black etc. 2 days ago I contact Fitbit who offer to send out a replacement….Great! Well the very day I set it up and they have sent me a faulty replacement! Cannot get my money back and basically it’s just tough luck that they’ve not sent me a working Fitbit. I am absolutely appalled at the so called “customer service” "
"Got the charge 6 and swiftly sent it back. You need to pay for a subscription to use all the features, and google wallet is a big problem that I can see most people have. It doesn't connect your card and the 'support' is as much use as a chocolate teapot. Looks nice but that's about it. It does the same as my £15 TEMU watch. I've now gone with Samsung and sooooo much happier. Sort it out Fitbit! "
Trashy & cheap. Mine just stopped charging so contacted the most unprofessional customer service person I had ever spoken to. Best he could do was offer me 35% off a new one!!! His apology said they make goods to last for life. Well mine didn’t & then they expect me to just buy a new one? I don’t think so. I’ll never buy another Fitbit again.
I have a 10 month old Fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. They've sent me an email response saying that it doesn't meet the warranty agreement to get fixed or replaced. I have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. The lifespan on the Fitbit is getting steadily worse and I will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge 
My Aria 2 has not worked correctly since the app update last year. Customer service is horrible. They repeatedly send the same troubleshooting steps that also do not work. They do not care to fix the issue. DIO NOT BUY. I would not recommend to anyone. I have live chatted and called at least 6 times with no resolution.
"I've been a customer for many years and have always loved Fitbit. Until recently. My Charge 5 broke after just over a year. I got a discount code for the Charge 6 and ordered one. This was May 20th and it was supposed to ship in ""late May"". Then it changed to ""early June."" Now ""late June"". I have reached out to customer support twice and they are no help. I have a feeling it'll just be an infinite backorder! It seems this is happening to other folks on the Fitbit forums, especially if they used a discount code. It seems that Fitbit is creating poor quality products and then not honoring the discounts they give customers when those products break. Buyer beware! "
I have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. I have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. I will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable due to useless app.
"I’m really fed up with my Fitbit. The way the sleep tracker was displayed was so easy to read and interpret. The recent ‘upgrade’ is awful, really hard to read and understand and horrible display. Come on Fitbit give your customers a choice to revert back to the display we had before. "
Removed the web version. Go fucck yourself
"I'm appalled by Fitbit's subpar service. A defective device from my friend was replaced once, only to be rendered useless by Fitbit's updates. Despite acknowledging the issue, they refused to provide a functional device or a full refund, offering a meager 50% discount on a future purchase. This experience reeks of prioritizing profits over customer satisfaction, leaving me feeling scammed. I'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. A class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold Fitbit accountable for their negligence."
yet another fitbit failed!  customer support is difficult to get hold of (I dont have or wnt a twitter / X account) so I have just given up after 11 years with a fitbit on my wrist..
"Fitbit has to have the worst customer service I've ever had to deal with. Long wait times ranging from 10 minutes to over 2 hours just to speak with someone on chat. And even in cases where they've they promised that you'd be able to chat with a representative in 3 minutes frequently turns into 12 minutes which is more than the 3x times as much or when they promise 10 minutes, but it turns into 30 minutes. Unlike every other company out there Fitbit gives you no option to have someone from there contact you back you're expected to give up or just stay on hold.The under day my friend was having problems with his internet when he contacted his cell phone company AT&T they told him the wait time would be up to 2 hours or more so they asked him if he would like to have someone from AT&T contact him back, he was able to have someone call him back withing 30 minutes and they were able to resolve his issue. They didn't expect him to just stay on hold. In another issue I was having problems with Amazon when I contacted them, they said the wait times would be long, but I could leave my number, and someone would call me back and someone did and was able to resolve my issue again they didn't expect me to just keep holding like Fitbit does"
"I’m writing this regarding a Versa 4 my wife bought for me as a Christmas gift in December 2022.  This watch recently died and could not be reset, less than 6 months after warranty ended.  Fitbit support offered a 35% discount on a new one instead of replacing it.  I don’t get fooled twice and I hope none of you out there get fooled once.  Don’t buy this product or do so at your own risk.  It’s not reliable."
My fit bit died.  Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot.  I was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where I live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through Payoneer.  So I had to set up an account. That time is now up and I have still not received the refund.  I advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which I was sent to set up the Payoneer account however that link has been used so I can’t use it again.  I messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!   Very frustrated and don’t know what to do now. 
"Used Fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. No charge, no screen, nothing. Don't even know how to contact customer service. Total waste."
Up until recently I would have given Fitbit full marks but the recent changes in how data is shown on the app has reduced this to one star. The final straw is how the sleep data is shown. There are many users unhappy about this as shown on the  community board but no comments from Fitbit who prefer to ignore their users. Well I will not be a user for long unless they change it back. 
"Update: On July 8th Google has removed the dashboard, which makes +1 more feature removed. Would rate this 0-stars if I could. DO NOT BUY ANOTHER FITBIT EVER AGAIN---Google has destroyed Fitbit. Poor app design, poor and ugly sleep tracking charts, no more challenges. NO COMMUNICATION.I will never buy another fitbit again, and I hope Fitbit goes bankrupt.Since Google has taken over, Fitbit has gotten 10,000x worse. The app is completely unusable an ugly.The sleep tracking is atrocious and extremely hard to read. This was done by Google, as previously, it worked and looked beautifully.Google has removed Fitbit Challenges. This was the #1 reason me and my friends bought a Fitbit instead of something like Garmin.The worst part of all is Google is too big to care about us. There is no communication from them. The fitbit forums have over 2,500 users complaining the last 2 months over the destruction of the sleep tracker, and they have not taking even 10 seconds to give us a response. Users also begged Google not to remove challenges, but Google selfishly moved forward and gutted them."
"Possibly the Worse Customer Experience I think I have ever had...EVER. Bought a Versa 3....barely used it (maybe a few months) - got stuck on the Fitbit logo - looked up the issue - apparently this is very common. Tried to call customer care but to no avail, when the operator voice message gave number options to direct your call, none of the options worked and then the phone cut off - tried this many times and calling to the USA isn't cheap. No Customer Service in the UK. Tried to use their online chat but again, I kept getting an error message. When I FINALLY managed to get through via the chat bot, no person was actually there on hand to help despite on their website saying the can help 24/7. After 25 minutes of waiting I gave up. So I've spent £160 on a device that lasted me exactly 6 months and no way of getting a replacement as I bought it on line from them or any technical support - this is RIDICULOUS. How on earth can they not go bust with so many terrible reviews??? I wish I had read them before buying. BAD BAD BAD."
Fitbit is definitely dying a death.  Since they got rid of the challenges and customer services became very unhelpful I've lost all faith in them.  There's so much more out there these days
"i have been a long time user of Fitbit.  I have had several products.  A couple of months ago my Charge 5 quit syncing with the app.  After numerous attempts with support, they decided to offer me a charge 6 at a reduced rate.  That device would not sync, so they replaced it and the next device would also not pair with the app despite several hours with support trying to pair the various devices.  I returned the charge 6 for a refund, but the refund department did not process the refund, so i had to call again and spend 20 minutes on the phone to tell me it will be another 3-5 days for my refund to post.  I am fed up with Fitbit and will never buy another device.  Their customer support is terrible."
Fitbit Charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in February 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. Would never buy another one 
"Versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. When reported, the service was appalling/ useless. They should be ashamed of themselves. I got useless unhelpful messages. They will surely go out of business."
"Fitbit app used to be excellent. It is in decline unless you pay their monthly subscription! I paid £400 for a piece of tech and can only use its full potential if I keep paying! You can shove it fitbit, no doubt you are making fortunes using all the data you have on us too! "
"Seems like their customer support disappears as you soon as you approach the end of your device's warranty.My Charge 5 which has a warranty until next month, no longer started charging as of April 2024. Contacted Fitbit Support, who were initially helpful, although slow as it took a few days to respond. They sent me a replacement USB charging cable, but that didn't resolve the issue. So they proceeded with a replacement, and I filled in the form with my shipping details. Didn't hear back for a month, and they told me it was sent to a US address, when I live in the UK! How is that even possible? I think they were just making up an excuse.Was passed back and forth between the shipping and customer service department, until they 'escalated' and said they would get in touch with me again to confirm my shipping details. That was over 2 weeks ago, and that confirms they are just using delaying tactics to force you to buy a new device instead when the warranty runs out.I would be very surprised if they bother to read this and then come back with the usual 'Could you please forward your details to us, and we will look into it for you', when I've not had much luck so far."
Be weary of Versa 4 packaging - product had unknown powder coating to the underside which has caused blistering and burn marks. Medical have confirmed this is Not an allergic reaction. Fitbit refuse to comment despite numerous attempts for 2+ months.
"What has happened to Fitbit nowadays and what are Google doing to them?  All they do is remove things.First, it was being able to sync your device with a Windows PC via the base station / dongle, forcing everyone to have smartphones.Then they removed the Windows PC app altogether.Next, they made everyone open a Google account, change their Fitbit login credentials to Gmail and move their data across to Google, where you can no longer download data of recent activities as an Excel spreadsheet or CSV file.You can no longer view your active minutes (sedentary, light, fairly and very) or your active calories without the download as it did not appear on the browser dashboard and it does not appear in the app. Moreover, you cannot view or obtain any of your personal data in a usable format. JSON files are not a useable format for most customers.This latest removal of something that is important (browser access to your dashboard) is symptomatic of their direction of travel and lack of care for their customers. Without browser access to your account, you cannot see your lifetime achievements. You cannot view maps of GPS tracked activities on a PC screen but have to try to on the app. The app is useless. The activity maps, when they do actually load, have a terrible resolution and the lines jump all over the place. They look like they were produced by a child with a crayon. If you have poor eye sight or arthritis, a phone app is a totally unsuitable way to access your dashboard.Now I have joined Strava and use my free account with them to view my Fitbit device GPS tracked activities on my PC and just use the Fitbit app to sync my device.Many of the features that persuaded me to remain a Fitbit customer for so long are disappearing. I suspect customers will soon start disappearing too. I will be one of them. What a shame."
"Google/Fitbit decided to discontinue the web dashboard, pretending that all the information was available on their app. In fact, many functionalities have disappeared, and not everyone has a smartphone - this also discriminates against people with impaired vision."
The device has been spotty over the last month. Three days now with zero info from it at all.   My choice was to cancel my subscription with 3 months to go as I paid for a month already with horrid service.  I was advised I will not receive a credit.  Not for the last month with no service nor for the remaining  3 on my subscription.  Clearly purchasing another Fitbit is out of the question. Their product dies and I am expected to pay for service?   I think not.  
I’ve had a few fitbits over the years. Which were good with no problems. I bought a charge 5 about a year and half ago. Which has broken 3times. But Fitbit only send you refurbished ones and offer you 50% of other ones. I’ve wrote to customer services with no reply as sick of phoning with rude customer service. Get your act together as you were good years ago 
"I woke up one day and my fitbit was frozen and I couldn't restart it. The customer service representative tried to help me restart it but it wouldn't work. They told me that I would be eligible for a replacement and that I would hear from them. I did not hear back at all and after 2 months I contacted them again. I spoke with Jasmine Mae. Unfortunately, they were unable to help me and said I needed to wait for an email from them. They were unable to give me a timeframe at all. They were unable to tell me if it would be another 2 months. They were unable to tell me if it is normal to wait for 2 months. They were unable to pass me onto another colleague who could help or help me at all. The only option I was given was to start all over again and try calling instead. This is poor customer service from such a big company. I suggest buying a fitness tracker from one of the other brands on the market instead to avoid it breaking and having no repair/replacement options for months."
"I am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch I purchased from Fitbit Charge 5 for over £100. My experience over the past two years has been far from satisfactory.The first watch failed after just 12 months, and although Fitbit replaced it, the replacement also stopped working after another 12 months. This recurring issue speaks volumes about the poor quality and reliability of Fitbit products.Additionally, when I reached out to customer service, I wasn't offered a replacement or repair but a discount that was only applicable in the US, despite being a UK customer for two years. This oversight was frustrating and made me feel undervalued as a customer.I am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. Due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, I cannot recommend Fitbit to others. I hope my review helps others make an informed decision."
"I am disappointed with the poor quality of Fitbit products. We bought Fitbit Charge 4 and Fitbit Sense tracker watches. On two separate occasions, the bands broke on the Fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the Warranty. The charging cable failed on the Fitbit Charge 4. The charging cable failed on the Fitbit Sense, with specific reference to the charging cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. The second charging cable also failed so I had to buy a third one. A few days ago, the top cover screen of my Fitbit Sense popped open, the functions stopped working, and there was no way to repair it. Several times, I tried to clip it back into place but failed each time.  Please see the photographs below for reference purposes. This Fitbit Sense was used very lightly and carefully, just for walking, not even for running, swimming, gym or sports.  I didn't expect to have so many problems with it.  There is online advice about how to solder the ""third pin"" on the charging cable and how to glue the screen back on, but the fundamental point is that these types of problems should not have occurred in the first place.  Also, gluing the screen does not necessarily resolve the complete loss of functionality.I am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of Fitbit products."
"No way to cancel premium subscription in either the app, the account part of the website or through Play. Customer service is unreachable and the help section on the topic literally just says ""learn how to cancel your subscription""- no hyperlink or article or attachment, just that. It is crystal clear Fitbit management have intentionally designed a system to physically prevent customers from not paying for a service they don't want. Dishonest, time wasting, theft."
"Fitbit Charge 5 ok when they work, but they fail, i had a replacement from John Lewis, perfect service from them. that one failed after around a year but I didn't have the paperwork so I was told I would need to contact Fitbit directly. That is where the pain starts. Customer service eventually sent a replacement under warranty, but they sent a silver one with light blue strap, mine is black case and black strap.. I tried customer service who passed me around as they were not able to assist. I finally got someone to discuss it and was told that is all they had and they cant do anything, if offered to pay to upgrade to the 6 if it was Black not possible. They said I could return it but are not sure what would replace it...could be the same again.I questioned the legality of it and requested they put it in writing on e-mail which they said they would do straight away with details how to return it, but nothing arrived.. They just don't care.."
"I have a Fitbit Charge 5 and went swimming in shallow water (snorkelling) and it worked as I got out but then packed up. Tried the reset as customer service requested but still no joy. Was informed that they would replace it (as it wasn't fit for purose) and they sent an email asking which one I would like (pictutres of NEW complete watches). Was SO dissapointed to be sent a refurbished watch without straps. Spent AGES on live chat and was told that they are randomly selected (even though they have new ones in stock) ""They are randomly chosen between new and factory certified refurbished. However, all of them are supposed to work properly"" It's like someone shuts ther eyes and puts their hand in a big bag and whatever they pull out is what you get sent and it doesn't fill you with cofidence that ""they are supposed to work properly""! Sad that a that company that is worth more than $2 billion dollars treats its customers like this. Only benefit of LONG chat was that they are now sending a strap (How kind of them!)"
"The app is not user friendly. Not plug and play. Steer clear of a product that you can't even find what model you have. Not on the fitbit.. pictures to compare are not clear. Plus the sleep tracker doesn't work and customer service doesn't know what to do except reboot, which didn't work. I can't emphasize enough how bad this product is. "
"Awful. Stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. Then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! "
Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart.  Can’t afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good
I don’t know what happened to Fitbit.  Now you have to order through the google store- beware you can’t return orders.  The online return feature doesn’t work and if you call they just blow you off.  I am out over $100 and no o w will get back to me!!!!
"I bought my 1st Fitbit 3 in Nov 2019 following surgery to help keep tabs of exercise taken. I then bought one for the wife for Xmas. My F3 broke 12 months later so I took my wifes who wasnt that bothered. That one also broke so F4 came and went then Fitbit 5 late 2022. Fitbit 5 failed Sep 2023, so a new one arrived under warranty from Germany after weeks of delays and messing me around big time. Charge 5 failed June 2024 just 8 months later... During nearly 5 years of fault finding, rebooting etc...I realised they are unreliable. ANYWAY this week...having established that Google are now in charge...I thought...lets give them another chance...so coughed up £119 for a Charge 6 via Amazon...so having years of experience of setting these up.. opened up the F app....then it requested my Google Account...which I entered...only to be told it wasnt suitable! What is going on? So I calls up Fitbit C/S who confirmed that Charge 6 requires a particular type of Google Account. Then we had a conversation about whether I was entitled to a refund for the failed Charge 5...that was negative.So my advice after trying to make Fitbit devices work for 5 years...is simply DO NOT BUY them!"
"Amazon Buyer Beware!!!While I have completely enjoyed my experience with my Fitbit Charge 5 itself I am very compelled to let everyone I can reach about the downside of my Fitbit experience. I purchased the Charge 5 this past July 2023 and over the Memorial Day Weekend it died. I spent hours yesterday trying to get some help being disconnected twice while waiting far beyond the timer shown in the queue. The chat was somewhat successful while the rep walked me through the various troubleshooting methods. Alas, nothing worked! The rep informed me that my “case” would be referred to the warranty department. Several hours later I received an email notifying me that due to the fact that I purchased the Fitbit from Amazon they would not honor the warranty that would have otherwise remedied the problem. AMAZON I think the largest retailer in the US if not the entire WORLD. Their orders have to be huge. They are not “Authorized Retailer” are you joking? I has been a hard NO getting any satisfaction from either Fitbit or from Amazon. They keep telling me to appeal to the other. Bottom line I am out of a working Fitbit worth $150.00 and neither will do a thing about it. How does that work. CONSUMERS be aware that if you purchase a Fitbit from Amazon it will not have ANY WARRANTY and the manufacturer FITBIT will not stand behind their product most likely due to the unit price they received from Amazon"
"My Fitbit just stop working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. The logo still appears with the progress bar when I change the face clock...So the screen should work? Support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! They dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! They dont even have a solution if I want to pay to have it fixed! No reference for a certified tech or something. I am so disappointed, I'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. My last hope was that even if the screen was not working I could still get my data in the dashboard on my desktop because the app in the phone wont pick it up... but now they eliminated that too! Lost cause Fitbit. On top of that the watch wont charge and the app stop syncing... But hey, the logo on the screen still appears when trying to access a face clock!  They dont care about us. I've had a few in the past and was very happy with my Charge 5 and thought this was the best watch I've even owned...but now, it switched to be the worse one over night! 200$ lost! They did not even offer me a solution to repaire it like a certified technician somewhere...! Garbage it has to go only after 2 years! Poor customer service. They offer me a rebate to buy another one! The nerves! Sound like it's planned, like they have a timer or something to create the glitch so they tell you it's finished and then they give you a rebate to spend more money!You think I'll spend more on another watch when I know it can die out like that without any help from them. FINISHED FITBIT."
Worst watches ever. Avoid at all cost. Been through 3 Versa and 1 Sense. All had to be restarted at least once a week. Eventually broke. All replaced under warranty. Painful that they just don't work. 
I'm a long time Fitbit user. I currently have a versa 4.The app has been nice up until this year. Suddenly the program began giving less sleep info and no graph on oxygen use during the night. This was one of the prime reasons I got the device years ago. Now you must purchase a program to get what was once part of your device purchase.I call B lls t!
"I am honestly disgusted by Fitbit. I’ve had three Fitbits in the last three years. The first Fitbit got scratched, so I reached out to Fitbit. They never told me that scratches were not covered under warranty, they simply gave me a coupon code to buy another one, which I did. After that one scratched too, I reached out to Fitbit yet again after one month. This is when they told me that scratches were not covered under warranty, and offered yet another coupon code to buy yet another Fitbit! I said that I cannot believe that a company as large as Fitbit doesn’t even provide a warranty for their products for one month! These are watches you’re supposed to wear 24-7…you can’t make a material that doesn’t scratch? They finally gave in and gave me another Fitbit for free. I’ve had this one for a year, but it suddenly stopped charging. After trying all the troubleshooting techniques that they gave me, they yet again said that it is not covered under warranty, and tried to give me a THIRD coupon code to buy a FOURTH Fitbit. I will never buy another Fitbit again! "
I Loved my Versa 2...just what I needed.  Unfortunately the screen became worn out and I am unable to replace itSo I bought the versa 4....ITS AWFUL AND NOT USER FRIENDLY...wish they could programme it to VERSA 2...I am a trainer and need it for quick access to timers like the versa 2 had...was excellent and fast...this takes ages to get to the timer and does not work for me as a trainer.
"Poor Customer ServicesI purchased my Fitbit Lux on 20th September 2019.  It has worked well and I have had no problem.  I paid for the Fitbit Premium.  When there was the handover to Google I could not log into my Fitbit app.  I have contacted Fitbit on Facebook and was given no useful adviceI have a different phone number so was not able to get the authentication code.I followed their instructions to turn off the authentication however still could not log into my account or get into the app.I contacted Fitbit via Face Book.  Via Twitter, now X, by e-mail to their customer services and also by telephone.Most companies would unlock your account with a password reset.I keep being asked to send a screen shot of the e-mail about turning off the 2 step authenticator.This started on the 1st June 2024.  Today is 13th June 2024.   My last call to Fitbit was today on my way home from work where I was again asked to do all the same steps.Never have I had such poor customer services.  Taking 3 years of premium subscriptions then taking a payment and locking my account.Now I am here and can see the other reviews I fully understand why.My watch is still in good condition, works but I can't use it as I can't sync the watch as I can't get into the app.I give up.This is not about the product but about a company that is not bound by UK consumer law and has extremely poor customer services.Steer clear of this company.  "
I used to love tracking my sleep on fitbit.  I loved the colorful graphs and information it gathered.  But since Fitbit has partnered with google the sleep app graphs are horrible.
"My Fitbit stopped working barely 2 years in. My first Fitbit lasted for years. The next two fell apart far too quickly. Pathetic.I got a discount offer. That's nice, and I appreciate it, but I would rather have a working item. The company is falling apart.  If you're not already a Fitbit customer - look elsewhere. I'm going to have to as the products are getting worse, not better, with time.EDIT: The item is out of stock. There isn't a delivery date; they won't transfer their discount to Amazon; nor will they give a free year of premium if I buy from Amazon. Nothing. I'm done with them.EDIT2: It gets worse. After speaking with an agent I cancelled the order to get the Inspire 3. And that's not in stock.This is pathetic.EDIT3: After a month I finally get the ""new and improved"" Charge 6. Except ... the ""Zone Minutes"" tracker isn't worker.This company has fallen apart. I used to be a huge fan. Now, I'm going elsewhere. This product is awful."
"Since last update sleep pattern useless, sit at computer for a couple of hours and it logs as asleep. New smartwatch needed but not a fitbit.Good way of killing a company"
"Inspire 2 no longer connects / pairs sync with I phone .. no matter what you do with the app or watch it still won’t work .. DO NOT BUY THIS or any other Fitbit product .. the shame is that I used to really like it, but have now thrown in the bin as a it’s useless and would never buy their products again "
"I've got a versa 2 which I've had for several years and it's generally been fine (apart from never being able to connect it to Spotify), but since one of the recent updates to Fitbit it now doesn't hold charge for more than 24 hours so it's pretty useless."
"I am extremely disappointed with the recent update to the sleep graph on the Fitbit app. It is nearly unreadable and has severely impacted the usability of my Fitbit watch, which I have relied on for accurate sleep tracking. Despite numerous complaints from the community, including my own, there has been no acknowledgment or response from the Fitbit team. This significant decline in functionality is unacceptable and has forced me to consider alternative products from other companies. Fitbit needs to take immediate action to resolve this and address the concerns of its loyal customers."
Used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. Too many issues..Customer services are hopeless...
The only reason I bought this was to see my sleep quality. They've recently changed it and it's rubbish. Now if you get up in the night and go to the toilet it seems to only count the sleep you have after that. So it's repeatedly telling me I've only had 5 hours sleep which is a load of rubbish. Now it's just a waste of time and space. 
"Can I  rate this company any lower than a 1 star? I have been dealing with an internal Customer Service Dept regarding an ongoing problem with my Fitbit Charge 3. All of a sudden the screen has gotten black and when I reach out to Fitbit they are unable to assist me with changing that situation. I have fully charged multiple Charge 3 units to 100% and have tried to sync them to both my Android and or my iPhone and they will not sync. In addition my email account is no longer working properly. I reached out to their telephone call center who has submitted my case to an internal department who after several days have asked me to provide them with the serial number off of the original purchase box which of course I no longer have because I've had the watch for several years. In addition Fitbit has provided me with one replacement watch which came with no box. I have on more than one occasion try to pair multiple Charge 3 units as previously stated but I am not receiving a four-digit pairing code on the watch to sync to either phone. As of today, Fitbit told me they are not willing to do anything further with regard to syncing the watch(s). I have called several times over the recent past trying to get the email problem resolved. FINALLY, after tremendous perseverance by me, I got the email situation resolved and have no idea why the escalation team didn't get this resolved in spite of it being addressed in many of my email responses to them.Perhaps, if they had more US based representation and less of a language barrier their service would would be better. It could not be any worse."
Bought a Fitbit Versa 2 in 2020 for my wife from Amazon.  It died after 18 months.  Give them their due got a replacement in Aug 2022.  This one has now died and Amazon will have nithing to do with it.  Do these watches self destruct in 18 months.
"I have had a Fitbit Luxe for less than 2 years.  First it was burning holes in my wrist from the metal charging prongs. After I built up a bunch of scar tissue there, I stopped having issues. However, for the last 6 months or so I have had problems keeping my Fitbit charged.  I get it charged to 100% and less than a day later it stops functioning.  I put it on the charger and it tells me that I still have a 93% charge, but it isn't funtioning or tracking anything. Then I get it up to 100% and then reset it and then it is back to 93% again.  I do this a couple of times and then put it on, but 12 hours later it stops functioning again. Fitbit made this tracker with a battery that cannot be replaced.  I did not spend over $100 only to have to replace the entire tracker every year or so.  If I wanted a throw-away watch, I would have spent $10 at Walmart, but even with those you can replace the batteries. I have had one for years. However, I wanted to be able to track my steps and my sleep and I have not been able to do either reliably for quite some time now and the Fitbit brand was supposed to be the best of the best and it is far from it.  This would be a great little tracker if it had a replaceable battery. If they intended the Luxe Tracker to be a throw-away unit then they should be charging throw-away prices of around $10-$20.  I am extremely disappointed with the tracker and will never buy a Fitbit again.  Brand means nothing if the performance of the tracker fails."
I'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. Love the technology but the product is crap. Our first one died in 2 years and now the second has died in 2.5 years the first time I wore it in the water.  
"Appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of a few days out of warranty, don’t waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market "
"Absolute shambles. Kids Ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. Can’t get any help! DO NOT BUY YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
Avoid I have a Fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told I’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount reluctantly I decided to use the discount and replace watch I have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service and after 3 days I’m no nearer getting my watch replaced avoid at all costs 
"I'm a Fitbit user since the beginning. 3 stars - The actual device (Versa 2). Should have lasted longer! Though the previous devices were worse, so this was an improvement.4.5 stars - Customer service for ""basic"" questions. They are very polite! (5 stars for availability!)0 stars - Customer service if you have a question that requires anything ""higher up"". They seem to have very little insight! Perhaps someone has their hands tied?My Versa 2 stopped working after a few years. I contacted Fitbit and they were helpful. After troubleshooting we found it was unfixable (HR monitor doesn't register). All fine. As it was not too far out of warranty they kindly gave me a ""1-time"" discount code for the newer Versa 4 device. So far so good.But then, when using the code I noticed that when submitting the order I was charged a higher price than the shopping cart said. I immediately tried to cancel the order, but Fitbit.com doesn't allow cancellations! I contacted them via chat within 1 minute and they said the only solution was to ""receive it"", then return it. Ok, weird, it was a weekend, but still fine. Fitbit can learn from Amazon and others here..Now my problem is that I cannot re-order on Fitbit.com because this time the discount code removes the item from the shopping cart. Possibly because it's used? When asking for help, they avoid my questions, and say this in email: ""We'd like to clarify a detail regarding the discount code applied to your purchase. We noticed you might have been under the impression the ""Out-of-Warranty"" discount code was used. However, to maximize your savings, we applied the exclusive Mother's Day discount code instead.""What!? Why?? I replied that when ordering I was using the code they gave me; the cart took it fine. I aIso gave them the calculations that ""Full Price"", minus this so called ""Mother's Day discount"" is still $20 more than Full Price minus the warranty coupon that I used. Now I'm stuck without an item (as I will return this one when it arrives), because I am unable to reorder a device with the warranty coupon. They have sent my case to the higher-up team and I received 2 replies that said the same as above.UPDATE: I now have another email reply from the higher-up team. This one still avoids my question on how this can be fixed on their end so that I can either get credited the difference, OR re-order. Here is what they said in their email instead: ""Thanks for contacting us about your recent purchase. We've looked into your case and want to clarify a few things. The out-of-warranty discount you received did offer a discount under $130, just like you mentioned. That part is correct! However, the final price you paid reflects the Mother's Day promotion used at checkout. Unfortunately, this promotion doesn't include free shipping. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused""That's it!? I didn't ask about that. I was just attempting to give them an easy calculation so that they could see the background to why I am sking for help. Their ""non answer"" is also incorrect because my order receipt from Fitbit.com says: $149.95 plus tax. That's it. I can actually buy it through Amazon, Walmart or Macys for that EXACT price AND some of them give me 5% additional discount because of my loyalty. Hence I would use them, not Fitbit.com. Regardless, this is irrelevant to what I'm asking.UPDATE again:I asked if they could  reissue the promo code (or fix the current one). They repeat the exact same lines as above. UPDATE again:I send them the screenshots of what the computer says when attempting to use the coupon...Their email reply came a few DAYS later: ""We apologize for all this situation, in this case we recommend you to receive the device that you already purchased and then return it back to us in order to process a refund, so you can place another order using the discount code.""Huh? UPDATE again:I asked if they were actually saying that the code would work after I return the device, and they replied: ""the code could work"".The item has now been returned and the code still doesn't work!I have now ordered an Amazon device (Amazfit GTS 4 Mini) to try it out.IF NO FURTER UPDATE HERE THERE WAS NO SOLUTION FROM FITBIT.In conclusion, I am NOT happy with the people behind Fitbit. This was actually a great device, and it needs to be backed by great leaders. This is NOT about the $20 at all, but about principle. Please, please listen to what your customers are saying. A little issue shouldn't need to end up loosing one."
Appalling DO NOT USE 
Constantly unsyncing. Utter rubbish.!. 
I bought a Fitbit Ace 3 for my daughter. Would not connect to the app. Absolute waste of money. Customer care is non existent. Please do not buy. Total waste of money. Returned.
"Shocking, I ordered another Fitbit versa 2 with 30% discount because the original watch broke and it was just outside the warranty date. So the 2nd watch also breaks, you guessed, just outside the warranty date and they offer the 30% discount!!!! I’m definitely shopping elsewhere this time!!! Shocking customer service!!!"
RubbishBattery drain after a year and nothing will resolve that. All the bla bla from customer support was not helpful and going into varies steps etc.. the battery drained after a minute or 2. Do not buy Fitbit products 
"Bring back the old sleep data.I was happy with my Fitbit until the recent changes to the sleep tracking data were made.It is no longer a user friendly experience, the old graph was so much better, easy to access the information at a glance, this new ‘upgrade’ is anything but! I am not alone in this view. Fitbit….please  Listen to your customer feedback!"
"My charge 5 is fully charged but as soon as the watch turned 2 years old, the screen stopped working within 1h of disconnecting from it's charger. It just switches off, yet when you reattach it to the charger it says it is 97% charged. Why is it doing this? I have reset it as per instructions via google help pages to no avail. I have tried to get in touch via numerous methods with Fitbit to no avail. Fitbit's post puchase customer service cannot be complained about as it's non existent. My watch currently makes for a very expensive rubber bracelet. I am now considering buying a Garmin watch as both personal recommendations and their reviews give me greater confidence that their watches last longer than 1-2 years and at $300, Fitbit is not a good purchase. I am deterring anyone from buying Fitbit as this is not the first time I have had reliability issues with their watches. This purchase was the last chance I was giving Fitbit to redeem itself but surprise surprise, this hasn't happened.  There are much better, more reliable products on the market and I think folk are better spending their money on brands with a better reliability track record and with a brand who provide post sales customer service. "
"Horrendous customer service. I contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth). Customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that I was entitled to a full replacement and that I'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. I was thrilled and gave the customer service agent a perfect score on the review survey that followed. After this, I received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled to a discount off a new device. They refused to honour their original offer of a full replacement even though they clearly stated in writing. Very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. They have since closed the case so I'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. A shocking customer experience. "
"Fitbit (or Google) does not care about their customers. I bought a Fitbit to track my sleep and fitness, but with the recent changes a once fun and colourful interface is slowly being replaced with an ugly and unusable UI. The most egregious example is the sleep tracking function. It used to be easy to read, but is now clunky, harder to understand and requires more navigating to see data.The Fitbit app was wonderful before Google acquired Fitbit. Now they’ve decided to push through a design change that is completely unwarranted and not liked by users. If something isn’t broken, stop trying to fix it! The design was so colourful and lovely, now it’s ugly and hard to use.Because of this, I cannot recommend Fitbit to anyone and am looking at acquiring a new sleep and fitness tracker once my old Fitbit dies. Please reconsider purchasing a Fitbit device, they don’t care about their customer’s concerns."
I have been a happy user of Fitbit since April 2014.  However since September 2023 it has all gone downhill due to a buyout from Google and change to the App.  The products themselves are good but the app needed to use them is dire since the first update last September which changed things radically making it impossible to read and access the data.  This latest update to the app has scrambled the ‘sleep’ data with many aspects now missing.  In other to gather certain stats one has to collate the data yourself.  There even longer any benchmarks include and if up you have an afternoon snooze the hours receded to the previous night data rather than that nights data.  I could go on and but I think you get the picture.
I have my Fitbit approximately 2 years. Sorely disappointed with the actual device. I have to restart my Fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. It vibrates at times to say it’s working. Consequently it fails miserably to read my steps and sleep pattern. Continuous work involved in restarting. I’m on the look out for a device that actually works. 
The new update is rubbish! Hate it!
"And it should be ZERO - pure shady ethics and dishonesty.I purchased a Fitbit Sense in 2022 and within 12 months (July 2023) the glass front separated from the watch. After a lot of wrangling. Fitbit said they would send an upgrade. I agreed to the Sense 2 but they said that it would just be the pebble and had to use the original straps and charger. I said yes and in a plastic bag arrived the pebble.I had no reason to doubt their honesty at the time. However two weeks ago I had a screen of death and when speak with Customer Services she said I had to disconnect and start the set-up process again. I was struggling to get it to work until she advised that it was because I had according to their records a Sense and not a Sense 2 watch.I found the emails from July 2023 and share these and was told that it would be escalated.Yesterday, I received an email stating that as the offer for an upgrade was last year it was a limited offer and the offer was not longer applicable.SERIOUSLY! So I accepted the upgrade replacement of my originally  faulty watch, and because they send out just the pebble in a plain bag without any markings etc i.e. not in an original box and there is nothing on the pebble unless you get a magnify glass where you attach the strap (I only learnt this last week) you cant identify the model. It is my fault that I did not know I didn't received what I requested.Then they had the gall to offer me an option to pay for an upgrade."
I was very happy with the previous graphs! Google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. And I’m not happy with the new interfaces either. Difficult to figure out. I think Google believes they had to change it up since they bought out Fitbit. I’m going to an Apple Watch once I save up my money.
"Bought a Fitbit sense 2 2weeks ago, went to charge the device for only the second time and it wouldn’t charge. Googled and this is a known fault with many negative complaints. Completely derailed my motivation and progress, wish I wouldn’t have bothered "
I also absolutely hate the new sleep screen and makes me even more certain that my next watch will be an Apple one. I suspect they are trying to move more customers over to a premium subscription but many customers will simply give up on Fitbit
"Fitbit inspire 3 refuses to sync with phone app, piece of junk!"
"Awful sleep tracker update has ruined what was a perfectly decent app. Sadly Fitbit will not replace it with the previous version. It is now a crawly mess and unreadable. Sorry Fitbit, I’m binning you"
"A year ago I would have given Fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the Fitbit experience: the app. Back in October, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. They won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since Google took over, they’re slowly phasing out Fitbit and the Fitbit experience so people will transfer to Googles fitness tracker.If you’re thinking of buying Fitbit, don’t!"
"Fitbit decided to ""upgrade"" their app. The entire design team needs to be fired. The updates are awful!!!!  It's become so difficult to track the various measures I use. They have made everything harder to read and find. Customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. This isn't about getting used to a new look it's about the updates being horrible to see and the information not as readily available. I'm cancelling my subscription as soon as I find a new device that provides me what I need in a user friendly format. It's a shame because their old format on the app was outstanding. "
"Sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, Bluetooth error, uninstall install again. Nothing, so bad. Waste of money and time."
the new changes to the fitbit app are absolutly terrible!It was once a very user friendly and useable application before the recent changes...I think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with Google.Shame - it was once very good before Google got involved
"It’s like google is deliberately trying to destroy Fitbit under the guise of ‘app improvements’ which reduce functionality, are universally hated and make the app almost unusable."
"I love my Fitbit Versa.  It has everything that I need at an affordable price.  The three star review is for the app updates.  This last update a few days ago is terrible.   Who thought this was a good idea?  It's so hard to read and understand, especially the sleep portion.  Google, you can do so much better than this!"
"I only ever post positive reviews of things, but I'm so infuriated with my experience that I thought I should warn others. I had a Fitbit years ago, and it and the app worked really well in their simple way - did what I wanted and all good. The old watch fell apart in the end - after a long time without any problems.Recently bought a Charge 6 and upgraded to the latest version of the app. An almost endless list of issues - the most obvious one being that the app constantly logs out, so I don't get any notifications on my phone and have to open the app, log in (which takes at lease two goes because the first one invariably fails), re-enable bluetooth connection, and manually sync the device.That means I keep missing the fact the battery has run out, and no amount of tweaking of settings will cause the watch itself to warn me. So I have big gaps in my data. On top of that, half of the functionality either doesn't work at all or is rendered useless by the unreliability of the software. So I tried, as suggested, to move my Fitbit account to my Google account, which required me to switch to kid view for my kids' accounts and upgrade them. There then followed the sort of circular hell of mixed credentials and logging in and out and having to set emails that weren't previously used (but for which account wasn't clear) and on and on until I was literally shouting at the phone, the watch, the dog.I've been CTO of international tech businesses for 20 years. I've built a lot of technology used by a lot of people. This stuff isn't difficult - and worked without hitch in previous versions. The current set up is a catastrophe and I've used up all of my former goodwill and shall be switching to something else."
"I see myself and many others have their fitbit account hacked. Some of the responses on their helpcenter goes to say that the customer read the email wrong which is kind of funny. They take no accountability for the their security. I recommend a Garmin watch, their software is also very good and can link up to other third party apps."
"Stay away. Fitbit is a con. They offered a year's free Premium service, which I signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. Spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". Avoid."
The new look Fitbit: tossing a coin would be as useful at tracking my health. And it wouldn't cost £10 a month 
"Trust the reviews here, customer service is a joke. Never ending runaround just to get a replacement for a defective versa 3.  After numerous chats with fake agents and phantom emails, I gave up. That WAS their plan.Update: two wks later.... nothing, no word, email, anything. BS comp and customer NO service reps!"
"I hate the latest update to the Fitbit app. The data is difficult to read, night's sleep hidden away in Other Sleeps, oxygen variability unintelligible, went from dark mode to glaring white.  Horrible."
"Changed the user interface recently to absolutely basic, unfriendly and awful. Can't help but hypothesise it was done on purpose in order to get Fitbit out of the competitive market."
Customer Service not fit for purpose.  My fitbit failed in Warranty.   They said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.   I believe this is a common occurrence. 
"I used to love my Fitbit and have been a loyal customer for over a decade. The app was always great, simple to use, easy to read, good to see how you were doing over time. When you got to your planned goal it was clear. Recently the app changed but the underlying sections remained usable, now the sleep app has been “updated” it is unusable. We comment but Fitbit are ignoring us, time to look at other offerings (scarily also the Apple Watch which I have always avoided) :( "
Danielle Stennett 
"Charge 5 worked perfectly and now I am on Charge 6, which is just as good with a minor improvements, all adds up to very smooth user experience. Sleep tracking is excellent, easy to use with a simple to learn UI and battery life is brilliant, last several days! Superb fitness trackers with a very competitive prices!"
They take lifetime to help you. they never refund. and never get back to you. never give you back any thing they make you sick 
"FitBit Charge5 stopped syncing with the Mobile app 12Apr 2024.  I bought it in April 2023. I tried all the steps available online and on the FITBIT community Forum. Nothing worked. 16 Apr 2024 - I had a live chat with FITBIT onine.They were helpful and my Fitbit is now syncing with Mobile app. I would have given a lower rating. However the online Chat person gave clear instructions to follow, was patient and allowed me to continue slowly with the steps.  It can get frustrating.  I may not buy FITBIT product in the future. That is my choice. If you are having difficulty please try the online chat which you can then save incase you have more issues in the future. "
"I DON'T LIKE HE NEW DISPLAY ON FITBIT, WE ARE THE USERS AND WE DON'T GET ASK WHEN YOU DO A CHANGE ??????WE SHOULD HAVE THE OPTION OF KEEP THE OLD DISPLAY ????????I'M AWARE THAT I MAY E THE ONLY ONE BUT I'M LOOKING INTO LEAVING FIBIT THAT I HAVE FOR OBER 6 YEARS.I KNOW YOU DON""T CARE "
"Changed layout today for sleep tracker, its shockingly pathetic. I presume to try make users pay for Premium( has Premium changed too I wonder).  The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily and the contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. I tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so, I presume due to so many complaints theyve shut it down. Time to leave...... bye Fitbit, shocking , and terrible customer service. HOPELESS."
I have owned every version of the FitBit Charge and loved them until Google bought them out. I despise all the updates to the app. They are terrible. They look like they are going backwards with how to present data instead of more a more modern feel.  It’s sad that I can’t wait for this one to break so I can buy a something different and it will NOT be a Google brand. I want. Nothing to do with supporting there fitness watch brand. It’s awful. Sorry you messed up a good product.   
Much the same as the other reviews here. Your paying for an expensive step counter none of the other features work at all. Heart rate monitor is just no where near accurate and makes the watch pointless. Customer support are equally useless.
"I adore my Fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. However, I'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while I was swimming. Despite reaching out to Fitbit twice about my concerns, I've yet to receive any resolution. It's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations."
"Bought new. Set up app once received. When I set it up initially on the app I used my email and a PW. About ten days later I went to the app on my phone and there was a Google sign in pop up. Stupidly I tapped it and was signed in. From that point on the connection didn’t work, Google who own Fitbit would not allow me to go back to a regular sign in. No connect, does not sync, customer service is a joke, and based on this super poor rating on a good review site we are all a bit stupid for buying this product. "
"Shambles of a device. Didn't last 18 months and they expect me to buy a new one at 35% discount. Absolute joke. Don't buy these products, they aren't made to last "
"I contacted fitbit after my fitbit stopped working within six months, i had a replacement approved and then when It didnt arrive and their was no further word i got in contact again to find out the status of my replacement, they then said that it wasnt covered under warranty and I would have to pay out of pocket for a replacement. Aside from inconsistent customer service, their products are of very poor quality as I had two fitbits break with no damage on my part in the space of 18 months. The fitbit I got in contact about was a replacement for a versa 2 that broke within a year of buying it. I was told my replacement had been processed but when i got in contact again its not under warranty. Not good enough."
I wish I would have read Trustpilot before I invested in the Charge 6. I'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. Of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. Total waste of money!IMPORTANT UPDATE: The 2nd replacement they sent gave me No Data for the first 3 days of wearing then gave me some for a few days then none.  HUGE waste of money. 
I have had 3 Fitbit charges none of which have made it past a year. The first Fitbit replaced with Fitbit charge 5. The third a replacement pebble. So I have had the same issue again with a black screen and no operating FITBIT and despite contacting customer services they are saying that warranty expired and can only offer 35% off another Fitbit. Warranty only applies to the first Fitbit despite the fact that none of the subsequent replacements have made it to 12 months. I quoted the sales of Goods act in the UK which states electrical items sold should be fit for purpose and expected to last up to 6 years. I asked for my query to be escalated to their complaints department and was told they don't have one!! I asked for the persons name and told due to security couldn't give it to me. Asked for the address for the UK Fitbit and told they didn't know So Fitbit your customer services is shocking your product clearly has issues as I have read lots of others with the same problems and clearly hiding behind the first warranty. I will never buy another and certainly won't be recommending. Let's see if you have a business in 12 months as I read you are loosing staff at the top regularly!!!
"Had a fitbit Charge 6 as a birthday present less than a month ago bought directly from Fitbit. Screen cracked. Not banged/bashed it. Fitbit say ""not covered by warranty"". My advice would be DO NOT BUY a fitbit. This Charge 6 product is sub-standard and the firm do not honour normal standards of customer service/consumer rights. Appalling, faulty product with customer service to match."
"I ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. Instead of my fitbit I received an empty box. I raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, I was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". Terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund despite never having received my item"
Had a charge 4 and it performed pretty well apart from it not linking up with my phone after a period and then the bit that attached to the strap snapped and it was no longer usable. This was after a few years so I thought if it lasts that long prob ok. Got a charge 5 and it’s no longer working. It was still in warranty but to try and contact Fitbit to replace the product is a joke. I won’t be buying a Fitbit again 
"Unbelievable lousy product and customer service. My Fitbit Charge 5 (2 of them), nor my Fitbit Inspire will give me a sleep score. I haven't had a sleep score in a year. I have been calling Fitbit for a year. They replaced the Charge 5, same thing. They want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. Why would I keep doing the same thing that already does not work. Told them to send me the replacement and I will send them back their 3rd faulty product. I will be switching. I am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product."
"I got fitbit versa 4 as a gift for a friend. There is a manufacture failure and I needed a new one. Best buy I was past the return date so I had to call fitbit customer service. This is where it all started. I called 3/25/2024 and I was told that I would get any email in 72hours with a return label (lie #1). nothing happened. called again was told it would be processed and i should get an email that day (lie#2). Waited a few days and ask for a supervisor. There wasn't one available apparently so I got an email from them. They stated via email that I would get an email (lie#3). No email. Called again, the person told me that the latest I should receive a return email would be Monday (lie#4). Come to today Wednesday 4/10/2024, no email, on the phone again with someone....This is beyond stupid. They keep telling me I need to send the serial number which I sent in the 15 EMAILS I sent to these people with information about this fitbit.  I have a $200 paperweight and I am getting nowhere with customer service. At this point I am at a loss. I regret getting this stupid watch. My recommendation is when or if you ever buy a fitbit to test it IN THE STORE so you never have to deal with their customer service. This company cheated me out of my money and has just tossed their customer service on an out sourced company that has no idea what they are doing. Now they are telling me since my first call and today the process on how they request returns have changed. IF YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH FITBIT CUSTOMER SERVICE YOU ARE BETTER OFF THROWING IT AWAY AND GOING TO A DIFFERENT COMPANY. I WILL NEVER BUY A FITBIT EVER AGAIN."
Had a lot of problems  with my charge 5 and returned it back to fitbit 23 days later it came back to me after many life chats didn't get anywhere then I got on chat with a lady called Paula she really sorted it out for me Sent me a prepaid  label  thank you paula
Can’t sync activity from luxe to Strava & online chat is no help 
"Charge 5 broke after only a few months after swimming. Multiple reviews online with same issue - pointless Fitbit claiming a fitness watch that isn't water resistant! On trying to warranty it, customer service was appalling. Put the wrong address on my return label, then wouldn't reply to me on Multiple attempts to get them to change it. Require a printer for a return label - who owns one of these nowadays in the 21st century?! We use QR codes. Requires DHL to return to Netherlands from UK, also practically impossible to get to one of these return places as they're only in towk or city centres open business hours which is when I'm also at work, funnily enough. Then only sent me a refurbished watch rather than a new one on replacement, despite my first new one breaking after a few months. Couldn't get hold of customer services for most of the return process or for anything out the ordinary. Useless product & appalling customer service. Do not recommend if you are looking for a watch - go for Garmin or a more reliable product & company"
"I bought a Charge 5 in 2021 .  It suddenly stopped working after 11 months for no apparent reason (note, I never got it wet, never knocked it etc).  FitBit sent me a replacement as it was in the 12 months warranty period.My second (replacement) Charge 5 has stopped working again - this time after 18 months.  It just hangs on the FitBit logo screen.  I've spend hours with customer service trying to reset.  As it is outside the warranty window, they won't replace and offered me a 35% discount on a new one.I've decided to get a Coros Pace 3 instead as I need to know that my tracker can last more than 12-18mths.  Whilst aroudn £100 more expensive, it will be cheaper in long run as hopefully just the one purchase.It is however very annoying - three years of fitness data/tracking on the Fitbit app that I won't look at again.  I got custom straps - now useless.  I got the Fitbit scales to sync with the app, which will now just be used as regular scales.If you're thinking of Fitbit, don't - spend a bit more and get something you can rely on."
Do not use Fit Bit - waste of money!I bought a inspire 2 in September 2023 and by December 2023 it wouldn't sync.I contact Fit Bit and went through a really really long process of trying every which way to get it to sync and they agreed there was an issue and said I needed to send the pebble back and they would send me a replacement - the postage label was being emailed...Never received the postage label - chased another 5 times only to again never receive the label and to again have to go through all the steps.Still have a Fit Bit that won't work so I gave up and have bought a Xiaomi and WOW what a watch!Bye bye useless Fit Bit - thanks for nothing!
" Re: Your Fitbit Chat Inquiry - #51130819    [ ref:!00D400N2lj.!5005a02kCPHB:ref ]I had a Fitbit charge 5 which was replaced under warranty (and going by the activation date, the replacement was a prior returned well used replacement at that!)Well, surely enough the replacement one went wrong after a while too (the battery lasted about 3 hours and was a replacement for the first watch which kept freezing on the Fitbit logo) I went on live chat who said they could see the replacement one was faulty and arranged to send me another replacement.3 days after live chat confimed this, they emailed to say they needed the old one back before they would send me a new one to my friend in the UK, which made things doubly difficult because they never requested the first one back and because I now lived in Tenerife Canary Islands and postage to and from here can be notoriously difficult due to 2 lots of customs checks here followed by checks in Madrid) I had to package the old watch and give it to a friend who was in Tenerife on holiday who took it back to the UK and gave the watch to her sister who posted it from her address in the UK due to FITBIT due to the complications and bring the replacement posted to her address out to me when she was next on holiday here. My friend posted the Fitbit for me and eventually recieved the package which she brought out to me in Tenerife not realising that a note written on the label when I translated it read ""rejected by recipient"" (Fitbit) I went on chat to complain about them rejecting and returning it to my friend unrepaired it for reasons unknown to me and they said the only way they could help me was if I returned the Charge 5. I explained I had tried, but they had rejected it and sent it back unrepaired!One day later, I recieved an automated email saying !"" Sorry!, your device is now out of warranty, but we can offer you discount on a new device if you send the old one back! The very one I tried to return to you 3 months prior!!!"
"Despite my Fitbit Sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration.  No matter what I do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (Australian) Bureau of Meteorology.  Never stops annoying me as it's rarely the same.  May seem like a minor issue but I just find it incredible in this day & age.  The other really unpredictable feature is Oxygen Saturation, because you can't control how/where your wrist rests while sleeping & I can't get a regular, daily assessment. As I'm asthmatic with COPD I need to know my oxygen level before a workout so I do find it incredibly annoying considering how much I paid for a watch to do this very thing.  Many people have posted complaints about this issue & the response is always to move the watch higher on the wrist & sitting flat.  You can do this every night & still not get an Sp02 reading!!  If a finger oxymeter works no problem, then why is fitbit so unreliable?!!  "
"Do not add Fitbit Premium free 6 months to your purchase! Ive been trying to cancel for a week and I'm in some kind of warped ""loop"".  I'll have to cancel my credit card to keep from being charged! YOU WILL TOO!"
"Fitbit charge 5 screen went blank, I changed the clock a few times and as recommended. It did work first time round and just stopped.  No doubt, I have now moved over to Apple watch, Fitbit reliability and functionality need improving. Much cheaper tracker, yet reliability and consistency score top marks and in the long run I assume Apple will pay the cost of constant replacement from Fitbit. "
"So i was using my both banc card in order to pay with fitbitpayI contacted their services to add a 3rd banc card, they did some troubleshooting found out that they deleted my cards and oblige me to migrate to google wallet without mu permission, and every time i contact their service they give a different lie"
Only because I can't zero star them. They've taken £55 without my consent and with no warning. Ignoring emails and no other way to contact them. I'm absolutely disgusted. I was intending to use them in future when the subscription would have been needed but definitely not now. Lots of ppl having issues with the shocking lack of customer support given that they charge!! 
Customer support does not exist other than a bot. I am trying to give them money for a subscription and just get sent in circles by the USELESS A.I. system.
This app makes it easy to keep track of my workouts and progress
Strava Support - there is no support. I have a paid subscription with zero assistance. They use their standard Q&A to answer but I need manual intervention as the Q&A recommends. What is happening Strava?There should be another platform that takes the monopoly maybe then they will listen?
"Was a long time supporter of this app as my friends and l ride alot. Stravas greed is something that has got us all withdrawing from the app and now use another app thats excellent & free. Strava has years of our data yet you are unable to go back through your past results and compare unless you pay their ridiculous membership costs ($100 aus.) like many if us are now doing, look elsewhere. "
I have been a Strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. They took two lots of money. The bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. Emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them.I feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. It’s such a shame as I used to really enjoy the app.
"wow, now that's what i call inflation, price gouging, taking advantage of your customer base - just got hit with a 54% price increase but no additional features! Better get a power meter now!!! ...$64.99 -> $99.99 pa(actually 53.85% 🤣)This is what's known in finance world as 'galloping' inflation - inflation of more than 10% pa. Not quite hyper inflation... inflation of 50% or more per month is considered hyperinflation"
"I've been using free version for years, but in last few month I have yo make sure I am bringing my garmin with me due to actually pacing for long runs, and distances as they are not accurate and if I was to go by times strava says I run kms for some runs, then you would ask was he on a rocket? Lol really disappointing especially after doing long distance like a half marathon or more. Thank god my garmin watch was with me that way I still have idea of what time and distance I did. 🙏 no option to add photos here to prove my review, pity as I have quite a few."
"So called Strava SUPPORT is HORRENDOUSLY BAD and NON RESPONSIVE!!Getting automated responses with dead support ticket update links!! In reality, there are no updates let alone a simple human response!!Here is my DEAD ticket number link given by Strava: support DOT strava DOT com/hc/requests/2557710"
Used to be good and I’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. My data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. Their support is not interested and you just get automated response before the ticket is closed. Subscription reluctantly cancelled now and I’ve stopped recommending Strava to others. Such a shame cos it used to be really good. Perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers.
"Strava has a complete disregard for its users. How many companies would actively keep silent about impending subscription price hikes, then remain evasive when asked by the press? The subscription isn't worth it either. You don't receive any better customer service (it takes over a week to get a reply to anything), and there's nothing unique that warrants paying for Strava. They're the least innovative company I've ever encountered."
I dont trust them. They may charge you an 80 dollar fee that doesn't line up with any of their subscription costs and then not give you any way to contact customer support without signing up again and going through the strava portal. There's no way to dispute charges after you've quit your subscription for fear of incurring new charges.
"I am not very tech savvy, but about a year ago I acquired a secondhand smart 'phone and signed up to monthly (i.e. non Pay As You Go) 'phone tariff. As a keen runner since 2pm on the 11th September 1988, I thought it time for me to fully join the tech infested running age and get the free Strava app that those in my Running Club were using. Alas, it did not seem to be available, so I signed up to an annual membership. I found it very baffling but that's normal for me with technology. I was once a very competitive runner. If I was more than a few seconds off my PB on my morning run I would fret! Old age and the effects of a bug having destroyed part of my lungs has changed that, and I am now just an enthusiastic plodder who knows his limitations. My needs are simple and limited these days, All I need to know is the distance run, the time it took and the elevation climbed. Strava does offer this, and much, much more. I do not need the much, much more and I am totally baffled by it - but I am paying for it handsomely. A year on and a little more tech savvy, I looked into other options that might suit my needs. I found one on google store (which is not reviewed by the running press because there is nowt in it for them) tried it out, found it met my needs - and its free! I have cancelled my Strava subscription.Strava may be the best option for enthusiastic, tech savvy runners, but for those with more limited needs, tech abilities or budgets, there are more suitable options out there."
Strava deeply joined into politics or Agenda and you cannot even say or show any wrong about it or ask them for decisions. My account was suspended then I put a few smiles (not any text) on them official pride post that cannot be hidden or turned off. Thank you Strava you showed me how censhorship and propoganda machine works.
"Waste of time. Subscribed to access heart rate analysis. Initially worked then stopped for no reason. Suggested fixes don’t work , response from support zero. Chat rooms full of users with same issue - obviously ignored . Cancelled subscription and deleted account."
"I used to enjoy using Strava until it became a subscription service. £5. a month is far too much for a service that simply charts routes. I have now found that the segments where you can compete against others are unfortunately often inaccurate. I have pointed out to Strava a segment where most of the top ten cyclists have managed to ride up a deep river or jumped off a bridge, also in other segments riders have managed to have average speeds a great deal higher than their maximum speed. Now Strava say I do not have permission to report these false readings. Why pay money for an app with such problems?"
"Great app, but customer service is non existent.Signed up years ago with an old email address which I no longer use / can’t access. My account’s still connected to Facebook however (so can still login), so I wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.Cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as I loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service.Will be looking for alternatives."
Heatmap has stopped working since the New Year. This  facility is the main reason i subscribe. Despite reporting this to them twice in the last week i’ve yet to get a response. Added to this there’s now another issue where it’s not possible to ‘Flag’ incorrect activities. The Leaderboards are pointless due to the high level of cheating. Surely Strava should be able to Spot when an activity is faster than world record pace and automatically flag it. I will not be renewing.Update: over the past couple of days Strava have been in touch and been helpful in resolving the problem. Just annoying that it took 10 days before it was solved.
Strava us to be sound but because of recent changes I can't even check out history of my own rides New costumers want know how good and useful strava us to be so they will think this is another crappy app which looking only for extra fees and will move on in search for another sports app 2020 is something else never stop surprise Peace ✌
"Application incroyable qui me motive à faire du sport. Je ne comprends pas les avis négatifs à son sujet... Il suffit de 3 clics pour se désabonner, ce n'est pas sorcier."
Strava has gone downhill lately. Having input a route using the app I found myself being directed down footpaths where cycles are prohibited and down another which didn't even exist! If I can't rely on the routes there's no point paying for the service.Emailed them to complain at the email given by Strava and it came back as address not recognised!
"I have used Srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones eg  one bike ride of 16 miles has been listed of one of 13 and one of 9. I have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. Using the Contact help Option is a waste of time. It just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant."
"Adding another 1 star review to Trustpilot in the hope that Strava will refund me the money they have wrongly taken from my bank account. I cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. There is no way to contact them. I submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. Companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. Strava, please refund me my money. Angry."
"Recently joined Strava as a free member due to the extra features over the Under-armour apps I were using. I thought Strava was great and I could compare myself against others on segments. This was my favourite aspect of this app. I can no longer see this information without subscription. So will most likely go back to using under armour apps. Less people will be able to see the segments so less people will try to beat each other, so even the subscribers lose out as they will be competing  against less people whom actually give a damn."
"Love Strava.The subscription model makes sense to me and they're delivering new features that I've wanted. For example, the mobile app now has a KOMs/CRs tab under Profile that gives you access to all of your KOM data. Very helpful and convenient.I use Strava daily, so given its importance to me I find the price to be  reasonable."
Great app for cyclists! It's my every day app for recording my sports activities. The segments feature is super addictive. No problem to pay 59 USD per year for it. Keep up the good job by continuously adding features!
"Love using Strava, the data I get is good even if it has to come via a Garmin but so disappointed that it cannot deal with Tri or Duathlons without splitting the event into 5 posts, 3 disciplines and 2 transitions.Garmin DOES record a Multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t Strava do the same given the feed is already done for them……..?"
"I paid for a year's subscription to Strava for boyfriend's Christmas present. I received a receipt via email stating that all I had to do was wait until 25 December and there would be ""one happy athlete"". Strava has still not sent anything - a terrible Christmas present which is still missing and they can't even blame Royal Mail...I look forward to receiving an extended subscription or a refund."
"I am not unhappy with Strava itself. I happen to have an issue with something broken in my profile.  When you then try to have it repaired, communication with helpdesk is a continuous disconnect. Answer after answer they (..) come with totally unrelated (random ?) feedback. It is either a very bad AI on their side or an incompentent person. And it ends with 'good luck' - without a resolution. In case someone at strava is reading along and has any interest in improving customer experience : case 2278210."
"Strava is a social app to show friends where you have ridden. It is not a navigation app and is very poor for navigation. It shows where you are but you can't enter post code or location to get to,  completely useless..They use a trick of free trail but you will automatically be charged from bank account via Google pay without warning. £47 annual subscription paid in full I'm advance. Its a con.."
"Honestly: its rubbishConstuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app I have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when I would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out, or just randomly stops recording becasue the sky is above me. on day when i couldn't give a pink flying fairy it is bullet proof."
"Hello strava, because it is super difficult to find anywhere to contact you it must be here.For some reason I might have agreed on a trial period to test your app, through google play. Today 09.57AM I recieve an email from google play, about my trial ends TODAY therefor you withdraw the annual fee today. absolutely unacceptable."
"No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. No. This is the entire money making model and it's even worse than Amazon policy on Prime. Next year it's calendared and I'm out for this reason."
"Very Poor. They supposedly offer a 2 month trial which is a con that sends you to a page which takes 1 year payment in full.Tried to sort this out with customer service but they don't reply, just an automated message. Need to employ more customer service if they expect people to pay annual subs."
"Use the free app for a few months and it was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides but, the last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few Kms so all the data is incorrect. It's put me off considering paying for the add on services."
"I accidentally bought an annual subscription plan. I quickly realized and sent Strava Support a refund request. After reading bad reviews on Trustpilot and Reddit about Strava Support, I must say I was sceptical of how long it would take, and if I would be getting a full refund. Strava Support proved me wrong. Fast response time, a short and precise text from a supporter and a full refund. Overall the app is great and Summit is good for data hungry beginners. Of course lacking bits here and there. Most of the bad reviews are just people complaining about not cancelling auto-renewal after end free-trial, and calling it a scam. Things that don't justify the product and Strava Support.Keep up the good work Strava and especially Strava Support."
"This company is horrendous to deal with. The support is virtually non existent. Expect to be ignored for weeks or months. As somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.Ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review, thats how bad they are"
Flyby shut down is major dum action performed by Strava - without any mails or notifications Strava turns of Flyby for everybody - for security issues ! Which issues? Everybody can see where you have been ridden anyway
"I've used the free version of Strava for a couple of years and have always tracked my runs with no problems. I tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. As a casual runner, I don't feel I need more detailed insights. Unfortunately, I forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. I quickly contacted customer services through their website where I was told to cancel and send details about how I subscribed within a few minutes. I sent these details and within a couple of hours I received a message from Hans who had refunded the amount. I'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where I know many companies have longer wait times than usual."
"Say what you like about Strava but it does what it says on the tin. Everything updates from my Garmin straight onto my profile, I am a subscriber so have access to their more advanced feature and it's a steal for the price. I don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. However it's a shame that you can't import routes from GPX files, or push Strava routes to Garmin Connect - it's only one way from Garmin into Strava."
"After many years on Strava they moved to a subscription model which gives me nothing of interest other than the ability to create routes (I can do that on GarminConnect).So I tried the Premium free trial. I wasn't happy that that free trial ended with no reminder and they automatically took my money from Paypal. Fair play, they have now refunded it. If I get flush with cash I may resubscribe but, for now, its the free version for me."
"This is a decent as a free app but they hide good stuff behind a paywall. That's fine, because it's a reasonable business model and you can't expect to get something for nothing but the cost of the subscription is very high and for me unjustified because the mapping is absolutely hopeless. I feel guilty using the free services of Ride With GPS, whose mapping is not flawless but is miles ahead of Strava. If they ever drop the free version, I will miss out on the inter action with other riders, which is it's USP but I will never subscribe because of the cost and poor mapping."
"Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance , speed, splits , elevation etc.. and have been pretty happy..Unfortunately started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily I kept my Nike app and it worked fine ....🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️"
"Downloaded for a trial. Clever, but decided not worth £48 vs Fitbit Ap (free) so I cancelled, but I’ve since still been charged the annual fee of £47:99 for it, twice now (£95:98 for one bike ride!). Account status is ‘free’ and subscription on Appleid is ‘cancelled’ but still being charged. Helpdesk ignorant. Needed PayPal to intervene after Strava closed my case 3 times without doing anything to assist, just emails to inform me each case was closed that contain dead links, so I couldn’t even see what they’d commented to justify closing the case. They couldn’t even identify the account they were charging me for. I fully expect they’ll charge me again next year. Avoid giving them your payment details!!"
"Really unhappy with the utter lack of customer service. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. Friend never received anything. One week later, and I’m still getting the “sorry to keep you waiting” automated reply that others have reported below. My own subscription expires this month. I won’t be renewing. Get your act together Strava. Changing the leaderboards forced so many more people to subscribe. Perhaps use that money to employ more people?"
Great product and social experience with a positive effect! Always enjoy tracking my routes and using the route building functionality to explore new trails/paths in my area. They have made some really good changes to the app and its well worth the subscription fee.
Strava needs to spend time fixing issues such as the fact Samsung watches can no longer sync and haven't done for months - I keep getting fobbed off by their customer services with cut and paste responses. On the verge of cancelling my subscription.Samsung users beware!
"Strava is a great concept. They deserve huge credit for what they've created - especially for cyclists. But F! For God's sake, invest in more server time on Amazon or whichever Cloud server infrastructure you use.I'm a paid user of Strava, and I expect better service than they provide.If you earn a KOM, It takes hours for Strava to process the leaderboard updates. Unacceptable.Step up your game, or stop charging us so much. Your quality is weak."
"Strava automatically took the £47.99. Unfortunately I mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake PayPal emails. I queried this with PayPal. Strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. No contact from Strava. As others have said, good app spoilt by greed."
"Good app, awful customer service system. It took weeks to resolve a basic problem. Each email takes 3-5 working days to get a response, and in my case the support agent took two of those emails to ask the same question twice (adding 10 days to the resolution)."
"When Strava suddenly discontinued their free version, they also blocked customers' past data, holding it hostage.  Strava should get up off the couch and sell some ads, like almost all other businesses with ""free"" versions do."
"I paid the £47 for the years membership. My membership hasn’t updated and I am still only receiving the standard free benefits. I thought it might be an honest mistake, so I messaged support with my issue with my attached invoice and still no reply 2 weeks later. The literally just robbed best part of £50 off me. Do not pay for this app!"
"I've been paying my annual fee to Strava since 2018. I paid my annual fee for 2020 but unsubscribed for just a month as I would be on holiday when I tried to restore subscription, it came up as 'error report to Strava help', I was then sent a ticket ways it might get back going which I found didn't work which has cost me many hours. I'm now asking for a total refund due to the fact the app doesn't work and that it shows I'm on free Strava and not paid? But I'm not hopeful judging by my experience with their help centre. I've also found in the past that when its working Strava isn't accurate"
Paid £47.99 for subscription and after a few weeks the account was suspended due to a mis-categorised ride. I asked for a refund or the suspension to be removed but they would do neither. They said I must change the category first but as they had suspended the account I was unable to change anything. The staff don’t understand how the system works and are no help whatsoever. Steer clear of this shower!
"I don’t have a positive view of Strava , they constantly add time cut average speed and elevation, also they now charge people for stats that were previously free . I won’t subscribe to get basic information"
"When recording cycling activities Strava is showing a much lower power output than is known to be true. Using Zwift and uploading to Garmin, training peaks and strava. Zwift, GC and TP all agree with each other exactly. So they problem is 100% with strava. It’s is receiving the same data file as the other two but reading much lower. Eg 1min@300w (140% of ftp) shows on strava as 220w- below my ftp. And it is calculating relative effort based on false numbers. It’s pretty much total fiction at this point. Not to mention the diabolical swim distance tracker. I’m a pool or outdoors the distance number has zero relation to reality. Even on know fixed distances it just adds 100s meters to every swim. This is supposed to be a tri watch ffs!!"
Strava will not speak to you to resolve an issue.  They send links to solutions that are very generic and do not address specific issues.  Their customer services are less than helpful.  My issue remains unresolved after two months - I have simply given up!
"I haven't been a customer long but I started receiving emails saying 'people mentioned me in posts'. I don't these people and want to remain private . I posted an email complaining to the email address, which assume is in the USA. There are serious GDPR issues and privacy issues. I have the same experience with FaceBook. I get the impression no US company is concerned about the privacy of individuals and don't take complaints seriously"
"Stop flyby instantly without notification or email... nonsensical. Sure you can activate flyby in privacy settings but 99% of athletes don't know or bother, and that's how the 2nd main feature of Strava is gone... BTW taking away most main features for free subscribers last year when it was the very reason we used Strava for years is nasty; you used us, the masses, as a stool to reach up and select the rich apples who now finance your lifestyle. Most of the guys in our group don't even talk about Strava anymore, it used to be the no 1 conversation topic. Pity the paying athletes don't see that and stop their subscription, it would quickly bring you back to your senses and force you to work for it and accept a few in-app adds to finance you to the same tune while giving paying athletes, who so wish, the option to pay the same price to remove adds in their Strava. Shame."
"I really don't know why people think this app is good? Its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. The home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. One star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app."
"This was the worst ever experience with a company. They have offered a 2 months free premium subscription - which I accepted because they started to charge for previously free features. So far so good, but after 59 days they have charged my card for a full year without a notification at least.I've a opened a ticket and asked refund, which they didn't bother to answer, and closed the ticket after 3 days because they ""never heard me back"". That's a lie. Even their support center doesn't show any reply from them. I have replied that the case hasn't been solved, and ""I'm not satisfied"" with their solution - still no answer.This company is a sinking boat still collecting fares."
"The app isn't bad but the customer service is terrible... I call the customer service number and no one answers, I leave a voicemail and no one returns the call, I send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer service person is unfamiliar with the app.  It's been a month and I have yet to get a response to my issue.  They want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of FAQ's"".  Strava has joined the customer service race to the bottom."
"Just had a brief look at the app, wasn't even aware I'd signed up for a subscription. Did not give any bank details etc. They took £54 through Googlepay, I was totally unaware they could do this, would not refund payment. Be very careful if you use their app."
"I want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless I join strava myself. I don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage with his profile being up there."
"It’s frustrating that you now need to pay for the features you need but that’s the world we live in! Never had any problems with the app, love using it & it’s very straightforward & really helps keep me motivated with my cycling!Love segments & goal-setting too. 4*"
"Strava exemplifies the ultimate low in customer care. My premium membership disappeared for no reason and their customer service is yet to answer for more than a month now. Congratulations Strava. Hope you are happy with the money you made off me. Unfortunately, that will end cause you suck big time."
"Started my fitness journey.A few months back I started tracking my walks. I do 2 miles a day minimum, and just being able to see all the data set me on my journey to lose weight and get fitter. I really like comparing segments so I can see my pace, and taking part in all the challenges.I now use Strava, and Garmin app together. Very good app."
"Customer service is non-existent. I have contacted strava on numerous occasions about issues with bills, my account, logging in issues - the list goes on. Not once have they responded to any of my bugs or small issues that I am sure would be a quick fix on their end.In this day and age, this is the least that you should be doing for your customers to then retain them. There are numerous alternatives that offer a better app and service. Sadly I will not be using this app again. Poor effort, Strava!"
"Used to be a great app, now they have changed it so you need to pay for the most basic of functions (say comparing your run with a previous matched run) that available on most free exercise apps. I know they had a premium service that could go in depth but now all basic functions are behind that paywall. My advice: use a different app"
"A reaaaal scam, i didn t even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my account, i didn t even fil anything, didn t put my credit card or anything, stay away from it as far as you can.I had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account."
"Absolutely the worst app ever! It does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! Hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! And again, keeps pushIng the premium for you to buy it again and again and again!! Should I say more?? Seriously, Strava dudes, I am running or walking for fun, I don’t need your super expensive subscription! I am done with I you!! As my friends are!!"
"Great app, although the recent changes about premium version made things a bit lamer for the free version.Also don't listen those who rate 1 star, they're just being crybabies."
AVOID AT ALL COSTS.I've asked seven times for my account to be deleted. I get the same answer or completely ignored. People can still access my data even tho I don't want them to.Indescribably angry.Poorest customer service and website I've ever had the misfortune to go near
"Absolute rubbish. Consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. Don't bother. "
"I was over the moon with strava until today , during  mental awareness  week and the coronavirus  outbreak , they decided to remove all the bits I loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. They couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   They should be encouraged You got it very wrong strava and I'm disappointed."
"I was forced to use Strava as part of what is essentially a sponsored walk.  Strava, and its inability to actually sync efficiently, has somewhat soured the experience.How much time and effort should it need to get your Cr app to sync with JustGiving"
This is with regard to Strava Support.  Have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member.  The app is mostly great.  However after renewing summit and paying for 1 year I suddenly lost access to this service.  Have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days.  Terrible customer service.
"Strava secretly fetching in extreme subscription cost across  the world . They don't answer to questions about this , id recommend everyone cancel their subscriptions and beat them at their own game"
I paid the £50 for the year only to discover that every run was only partially recorded ( unlike on my samsung app) i found it difficult to get help from them and when I did it was incomprehensible instructions then a time limit before case closed. Wish I could get a refund . Waste of money
"Awful, awful, awful company.  I had over a year's worth of records with them which was very valuable to me sentimentally.  I've opened up today and ALL of my records are lost, I've lost my contacts, and it says I have to start a free trial even though I paid for a full year less than two months ago - what a con!  I know that this is the same account because I had one activity several months ago which has been permanently stuck as not synced and that is still there, the only thing that is.  If you want a company to rob your money, then look no further than Strava.  James."
"Trying to contact Strava is impossible … trying to adjust one of my activities but I can’t do it , have to get Strava to do it but they don’t aknowledge you !!!"
What a great app Strava is. I can build my cycling routes easily and also share them with my fellow-cyclists.And the coolest thing is that Strava can connect with multiple cycling computers. Even those that are sold on Aliexpress. Which makes it easier to follow the routes I build in the Strava app.
Scammers. They stole my money and just got to know that they are also racist saying horrible things adout Arabs and black people on Instagram 
"Strava joined politics and AgendaStrava deeply joined into politics or Agenda and you cannot even say or show any wrong about it or ask them for decisions. My account was suspended then because of official pride post that cannot be hidden or turned off. Why this propaganda. If you share this Pride thing why not listen anything else? They closed that post to comment. I told them please open my account again but nothing change. They didn't ask me back. Now what will happen to my 6 years works. Koms, records etc... Why there is not a warning! Why suddenly suspended... I am really upset till 2th of june."
"BEWARE OF THE FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION OR ANY OF THE SUBSCRIPTION OPTIONS!!!!Its almost impossible to cancel the subscription, and they charge you 1 day before your subscription runs out. Contacting any person to deal with the issue is impossible. Sure the App works great but when trying to cancel your subscription, NOT POSSIBLE!!!"
"Lost ALL my data. Tried to download a club ride to Strava from Facebook. Was asked to change my password and was then dropped into an old version of my account. No data, and no way of contacting anyone at Strava either to help retrieve it. Emails to the 'help' desk just disappear. And this is on the paid-for version of the app too, which has also disappeared."
"It was free before, but now all main core features are under subscription. 50$/year maybe is not affordable for everyone, but there are lot of ways to monetize (20$/year?), ads, value add features?"
"I have been using Strava for nearly 3 years. It's great an compatible with my Apple Watch. I have rated it 4 stars because the have removed feature, making them ""Summit"" (premium) features. I use it all the time and its a great way to get stats on your sports. The free version works well enough for me - a teen who is just aiming to track and improve. The paid features can give lots of insight into you heart rate and all kinds of other stuff, so it really suits all needs."
They underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. When I realised that I was going to be charged I cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money. They won't issue me a refund now. Really angry.
"Apparently the price for Strava Summit is different, depending on how you buy it. On my phone the yearly membership is 449 DKR/year, but on my pc the exact same membership costs 589 DKR.I would like to order, but now I decided to avoid it, as I have no way of knowing the exact price.I smell a hustle!"
Has of 4.3.2023 I decided to delete my free account with strava. Because for the second time this app has had a server problem that has literally wiped all my progress from the 3 years I have used it. And removed all my title edits & my profile picture. I personally think this is deliberate by the Strava tech team. So you will subscribe. Why offer a free version if this is what they do.Glad I never subscribed I will stick to my Garmin & pay for a one time offer with Komoot.
Strava has been my go-to cycling app so I recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. Now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my Strava feed. I followed all of Strava's troubleshooting to no avail. I need an app that is consistent and records ALL my rides. I know some of you will think it is user-error but I assure you it's not. Very disappointing!!
They have charged me a premium subscription of 55.99 Euros without authorization and that I never requested. I try to contact support and they don't answer.I see in some comments from people that the same thing happens and it seems that they are trying to steal people's money.
Im trying to contact strava about them taking money from my credit card that I do not remember giving them permission to do so.  l cancelled my account.  But I cannot find any way to contact them now .. I am disputing them taking the money out but would like to talk to them .. but unless I sign in with a new account I cannot find any way to talk to them.  I am reluctant to sign in again .. Can anyone help
Another good app that's ruined by greed. These premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra.
"My account of years is inaccessible, following a recent “upgrade”.  As well as a training record of multi-sport mileage, & fun, it was also a photo travel diary.  I don’t recommend using this site as a training record."
"Always enjoyed using Strava with my phone but bought my husband a Samsung watch and the Strava app doesn't sync at all.  He went out and did a brilliant time, as he wasn't having to hold his phone, and then the watch wouldn't sync to his phone.  This is not a watch issue... Issue is the Strava app.... Loads of complaints from paying customers.... So they release an update.... Which is no better!!! Come on Strava... First you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! Cancelling membership"
"For some reason I ended up with two accounts...took months to get my data from the old account...opened two ""tickets"" to support as the instructions on re-uploading the data were unclear/didn't work...gave me advice that as a non-techie I couldn't make work..then closed the ticket ....then, when I clicked to give feedback...I couldn't ! As they had logged it as 'solved'. It wasn't."
"Refused to honour a price that they sent to me, when asking to speak to a manager they said “no were closing the ticket as it is resolved”. When I disagreed they said “pay the money or cancel, we’re not honouring the price as we have no ability to”. So they aren’t interested in customer satisfaction, they aren’t interested in honouring what they say AND they refuse to even follow standard complaint processes! TERRIBLE COMPANY, steer well clear if you value your money there is plenty of apps that offer the same thing cheaper and they can’t treat you any worse than this company will, so it’s a no brainer."
"When you stop payment to Strava they cancel all your records, time etc."
"Do not even think about using Strava.  It is 9 miles of bad road.  There website look like a phone book, nothing seem to work even after great effort, and there is no meaningful help.  There is no phone number to call and no chat help.  If you request help, you are sent 30 articles to read.  My bike map is completely inaccurate and has you taking impossible routes.   You never know when it is on and you often get no record of your activity.  Use the Apple Fitness App instead.  They have support and do not charge."
An apparently rubbish company that seems to steal your data and misuses it. They somehow got hold of my email when I have absolutely no interest in what they have to offer and I have never expressed any interest in them whatsoever.
Non existent support.I raised a query with regard to payment at Strava. I contacted support and didn't even get a response. I am paid member too! I will not be resubscribing again as they didn't have the courtesy to acknowledge my request.
No longer able to compare results with friends without sunscribing etc. Without it the app is pointless and definitley not worth the subscription fee.I thin we are about to see the decline of strava when those who pay will have no friends to compete against?
"I have subscribed for a trial period. I have requested refund before 14 days cut off. Fraud company, no response from customer service. Avoid at all costs!"
"You deleted my post on your facebook so I'm posting here too to hopefully get an answer from you.I have been charged £47.99 for an upgrade to your app that was sold to me as a free trial for 14 days. I was completely unaware that you would immediately take nearly £50 as the notification on your app says 'free trial'.I have tried to issue a refund through the app store, within minutes of making the purchase and apparently, I am not eligible and I have no idea why.This is completely unacceptable and I don't know what else to do. Please refund me this payment. £50 is a lot of money for an upgrade that I have not used, especially when your notification on the app advertises it to be a free trial. Please."
Strava used to be good but they do nothing about E bikes or rides being recorded as runs ruining the leaderboards. If you want to compete on climbs it is pointless as they could easily use an algorithm to detect e bikes or just give people a nudge if the activity looks incorrect. Most people record what bike they used so even it is confidential to the user they could ask you to log if it is an e bike or regular bike. Any city road leaderboard for runs is dominated by people on bikes. It used to be a good training tool to try and climb the leaderboard and compete with others but it is useless now. If there are 500 runners on a segment the top of the leaderboard is unlikely to be someone who's done their first 5km run and recorded it on an phone. This would be obvious to Strava and they could just give you a prompt before you save the activity. Then they started charging for the privilege and giving almost nothing back in return. They say you can flag an activity but it shouldn't be up to you to identify millions of wrong activity recordings. For these reasons I'll be getting rid of Strava.
"There is a very good reason why STRAVA only has a 1.9-star rating on this website. If there was an option to give no stars at all I would have opted for it instead.I was gifted with a STRAVA membership 17 days ago and I accidentally loaded it onto a new profile instead of my old faithful (previously free, still free now) profile. I immediately logged a query for someone (seemingly STRAVA only has 1 employee) to ever so kindly assist to load said gifted subscription to my existing profile. Roll on 17 days and 6 runs later and they have still not replied to my query.I have sent numerous follow-up emails to no avail. Kudos to STRAVA, the company, for not having any telephonic contact information available because hiding behind such a superior lack of communication to your subscribers is certainly a form of art! It goes without saying that I am one very unhappy STRAVA subscriber!"
Don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. I upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email. 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. Really terrible customer service.
"It’s took 10 weeks to get the problem solved which, with appropriate and simple direction could have been solved 9 weeks earlier. Strava subscription way too expensive for this uncaring service. I won’t be re-subscribing and would ask for my subscription refund if it were possible."
"Good app. I use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. The only thing is disappointing that Strava made progress tracker paid. And after updates I can't find the activity that I completed the same day a year or more before."
"Strava don't answer requests or complaints at all.. Seeing less and less features on their platform, their only focus is the sosial part.We did not join strava to use it as an Facebook replacment."
"Despite the fact the free version of the app is pretty limited I still can track my routes on the bicycle.But be aware that if you want to measure the speed properly, then don’t look in the Strava. buy the bike computer instead."
"So you cannot cancel in the middle of a yearly membership, you can only non-renew. I had no issue with that. What I had an issue with was that after I non-renewed they charged me for renewal?! I could not get in contact with anyone. There is no way to report the error. All you can do is try and non-renew again and hope for the best. I am trying to get a refund through google pay and I requested the deletion of my account. I better not be dealing with this next year. Any company that is happy to take your money but gives you no recourse when something goes wrong is unethical."
"Terrible from the very beginning. As countless other people have stated Strava has no customer services department. I’m not being dramatic they literally have nobody working in customer support. Queries, questions, suggestions and complaints are all ignored. There is no contact number of course (why would there be when there is nobody working there) so the only way to get in touch is by email which of course has nobody attending the mailbox. The app itself has a TERRIBLE user interface. It’s almost impossible to find and follow people you know even when you try to sync contacts or friends on Facebook it’s still impossible to find anyone. Recording of activities is more often than not incorrect, with huge straight lines that you never walked/ran or your entire activity is in zig zag lines making it look like you’ve travelled more distance than you have. It’s really just a very very bad app through and through. There are countless better apps out there for free. Do not waste you’re time with Strava"
Alex M (team Strava support) answered my request in the Strava Support place knowing that i cannot enter in Strava becose i am suspended! shame you Strava you are the worst.....
I had a free trial which they offered to extend by 30 days. I accepted and about 5 days later I was charged the full year. They said they would re-fund but I've not heard anything and received no refund. They are taking peoples money without permission and I don't intend to accept it.
Customer service is atrocious and non existent. Signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Nobody responds to requests for assistance
After using Strava for free for 5 years I decided to take the annual subscription.  But I have been charged twice.  Once by Google Strava and once by Strava.  Neither have come back to me to resolvce this and its already been 48 hours since I contacted them.  Have unsubscribed and will be deleting my account if I dont hear soon.
"Once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay, kind of daft when theres 100s of other apps out there that do the same thing better and for free."
"If I can give them no stars then I would!I have a free account in the UK, which I’ve never paid for. I used it twice in San Francisco for two bike rides and Strava have charges me two lots of £47.99 on the same day!! The app never asked for permission or credit card details. They just helped themselves to my money. I really don’t know how!I will be cancelling my account and reporting the fraudulent transaction to my credit card provider. AVOID!!"
"Worse customer service, actually customer service is non existent. So hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. Don't sign up, the original service was so much better. Avoid at all costs"
"Clearly Strava have no intentions to really support sports other than swimming, cycling and running as complaints about the lack of information delivered for all other sports options can be traced back around 5 years at least. Seems to me that advertising Strava for any other sports is really false advertising because we can't extract much meaningful data from non-Strava sports. There is not even a distinction between off-road and on-road running/cycling, or pool/open water swimming which are very different sports in their performance elements. Splitting, e.g. watersports into the various components is obviously just a lame attempt to disguise the fact that Strava don't care. If they were prepared to support watersports they should devote the same detail to them as their core sports instead of providing a token option. Further evidence of their lack of interest is evident in the extremely limited options for clubs to build leader boards. All up, very poorly done Strava. I can see why so many athletes are no longer using your platform when I look across the opposition offerings."
"The free trial is a SCAM. I signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. Well, every time I went to cancel it ""glitched"" and I ended up being charged. So I emailed, filed a complaint with PayPal and left a bad review before I could get anyone's attention. They claimed the canceled. Well I just got charged AGAIN. IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH IT. I am so livid."
"Beware of the ""FREE TRIAL"". They charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. I felt tricked, and although I liked the app, I cancelled the service. Can't trust them anymore."
Very disappointing! Miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? So every day rong data !!! You pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! 
"Watt/HRR/speed never corollate with Garmin or TrainingPeaks values  - annoying. Shut down of ""fly by"" is a huge mistake"
"The sign-up process is very clear that  it is possible to use your product privately – ie without sharing anything with other Strava users. Yet on using the account it is also very clearly stated that “parts of your profile” will be compulsorily shared with other Strava users. Clearly you have contradicted yourselves here. It is important that we are all able to control and manage our online presence through effective and workable privacy management tools but your disingenuous promise of privacy would clearly prevent that. Furthermore attempts to reach your privacy settings, “further” documentation describing your policies with regard to privacy, were all met with a message that these resources were unavailable. Strava is a newish product which should have learned from the well-publicised privacy failures of other providers of online services - it appears not."
"I also inadvertently bought a 14 month subscription thinking it was a free trial (the get two months free causing the confusion) however the response to my email (cancelling my paid for subscription and sorting out a refund) was done quickly and without any fuss.Only feedback to Strava, maybe think about how promotions are worded to avoid confusion in the future."
Shocking move by Strava to remove all the comparison data from the free aspects of the app.  Takes away any reason to use it now.  Big delete button from me.
"I cannot see why to subscript. The price is extreme since the longer you use the app the more you pay, way to tell your customers how much you love them! Why can’t I just pay once? I also think the extra features are useless to me. I have cancelled my subscription, and will use the free app."
I just downloaded ‘free’ app only to discover its free for one month.  It’s then a nightmare to unsubscribe or delete account.  I hate this kind of sales tactic.
Today the app stopped recording 8 times in less than three miles. Once to ask if I wanted to change settings. Once asking to access my photos. Once trying to get me to pay for a premium subscription. The other times just because. This isn’t the first time it’s pulled this.
"Great app when working, but truly AWFUL customer support. I've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. Do NOT expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support!"
"Have removed key features from app e.g. 100, 200, & 300km monthly running badgesThis is not what I just paid premium for.  I would like a refund please.  Oh and their support team has yet to respond to any message, by any means, over the last 2 days."
"I cancelled my subscription but,they  will not give back my money,no help at all.waiting for papal to help me!Transaction ID81H15005Y07165833 Invoice ID9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company."
Signed for a free trial and then they took $99.99 without informing me. No way of contacting them to dispute. Website says take it up with Apple. Scam
"I paid for an annual subscription in December, 2021. Strava continues to invoice me for the subscription. I have proof of payment. I am not receiving the service that I paid for. Customer service is nonexistent."
I love the community aspect of this app to help motivate my running. Especially in lockdown it makes me feel like I am not running alone
Pros:- Easy to hide your poor performance - exaggerate your performance - stay accountable - find the steepest downhill in Melbourne - competitiveLove Murder She Wrote
"Completely ripped me off, the offered a free trial for the full version, I pressed yes and instantly 54.99 came out my bank.Contacted them and Apple and nothing could be done. AVOID AVOID AVOID THIS APP!!!!!Hidden charges.And after the charge didn’t even have the full version. Shocking!!"
Strava is an ok app but has it's problems that need sorted out.1) can't tell if you walking or in the car if u forget to pause it2) Again if you don't pause it and leave it say on a table the distance will go up without it moving from the table
"Strava is not worth using, it doesn't sync, none of the suggested options in support or online work. Better to use another app."
"I'm very disappointed with Strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. The app isn't ""here's my hard earned cash"" good."
"I've been using Strava for several years.  I've enjoyed recording trips, and use it for my all of my cycling, and interesting walking (esp. overseas, where I'm not always sure where I am).  I have about 20,000 km of records stored in Strava.About 3 years ago I subscribed so that I could share my path in real time with my kids using the Tracker feature.  It was also a safety feature, as I often ride or walk solo, and sometimes in remote and adventurous places.So far - EXCELLENT.When Strava increased the subscription by approx 500% (yes, really - **500%**), I cancelled because I don't need Tracker so much as I do overseas.PAIN - I can't compare my rides with friends and within my club.PAIN - I keep getting hassled by Strava to subscribe.HORROR - today I find that I no longer have access to the dozens of MY carefully planned routes.  It took me many, many hours of work to create those routes.  No warning from Strava that they would ever require a subscription to access.  I'm the author of those routes and they are my intellectual property.  In my opinion, what Strava is doing is the same business model as RANSOMEWARE: to block a user's access to their work until a subscription/ransom is paid.I can't find it in my heart to send a subscription to such an unethical company, so will have to work at rebuilding all of my routes in another App.  Fortunately, Strava's Route Creator is no better than free Apps."
"My annual subscription renews tomorrow, and the money was taken today, but Strava will not refund and cancel the subscription until next year. Strava are firmly positioned on the bottom tier of customer service. Unnecessary and short-sighted."
Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so I didn't use it again. Today Google took £47.99 from my account. Tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find). Google then declined my refund. So basically I just handed over my money for nothing. That is one weeks food shopping in my house. Unbelievable. What sort of business does this? Strava doesn't care. Google doesn't care. No-one cares. You can't speak to anyone. No humans. Dreadful. There should be laws against this!!
"Too often if you stop, check the distance and then continue the app doesn't resume.  This has happened many times."
"I used for around 4 years in the free mode as I don’t need to know what other people are doing. Got persistently pestered to buy a paid subscription that I don’t want. Then they turned off the lights, so I turned them off. Use map my ride now, works fine, got no issues.As mentioned - Pure Greed"
Very inaccurate. I became suspicious of my times so started checking them with a stopwatch. I found Strava to be +/- up to over a minute on a 20 minute run.
I just had a £54.99 charge to my account which i know nothing about / please do NOT use this app unless you want to go through the PAIN of dealing with refunds on iTunes Store…
I wouldn't bother half the time it doesn't record !! My husband uses Google never any problems it also has sound.
I reported a route with a highly offensive slur in the name 10 days ago. Strava never even responded. I’m leaving their app over it.
Almost everything that used to be free is now a subscription feature. Almost unusable on the free tier sadly
"It's an okay app I guess, they've now decided that we have to pay for the features that used to be free. The app runs well most of the time but sometimes doesn't work as well. Other than the negative, a good app. They need to sort the money business out. SORT IT OUT STRAVA!"
I use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great.
Getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe.  Constant emails asking to subscribe.
Awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not.  Try a different app.
Beware ! Signed up for 30 day free trial. Cancelled my account before the 30 days and still got charged €59.99. Emailed them about this issue and got no reply.
"Never know such a company, I downloaded the app over 18 month ago and PayPal have been taking £5.99 pr month since, however I have been trying to cancel for the past year, but it wont let me and theee is no contact no, this review is written out of sheer desperation, as  my 22 year old daughter in law passed away a fortnight ago and I have had to quit my job to look after my 10 month old Granddaughter, please can you cancel my subscription and cancel my paypal payment, Mrs Fiona Burdon, tel no 07860 813218"
"this app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible."
"They support is non-existent, I pay for premium on an iPhone, not a no name brand and the premium features never come on I have tried everything thing they recommend god forbid they should supplying customers."
The app is constantly crashing. I've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. Waste of money. Will not be renewing
"I was looking for an alternative to the very unstable Endomondo, and was told that Strava was the way to go.I use a Garmin watch as my tracker unit and through that I use Garmin Connect to analyse my runs.Endomondo and now Strava should be my backup-place, so I would have all my activivities in a unit-independent place if I later on got a new running watch from another brand.I said yes to get 2 month for free, and now I was ready to move all my data from Endomondo to Strava. But...For some weird reason Strava has a limitation on uploading activities manually. It will take forever to move all my history from Endomondo.Next I found out that Strava is all about competing with others through segments and thophies. I'm not into that - I compete against myself.Okay then... If only Strava could give a good overview over my personal records based on my activities. But... No. You have to enter PR's manually. What!? Why on earth should you do that? I have several routes that I sometimes run one way around - and sometimes the other way around. Can Strava then tell me what way I have run? NO! They don't put km-markers on the map... Very basic feature, that all other running apps have.I can see that a feature-request have been made for this back in 2017 - and nothing has happened.I'm skipping Strava again... And hopefully Endomondo will start being more stable again."
"Horrible. Buggy, buggy software.  On iOS you will want to pause your run/ride and perhaps take a photo, open Facebook.  When you return to Strava two out of three times it will refresh and lose all data.  When you open a ticket, someone eill look at it for two se nods and cut and paste.  Bunch of boilerplate into your ticket and hope you go away.  Even opening the ticket is intended to discourage you.  The ask things like app version/OS version.  Write in “most recent”. The have the ability to know exactly what version you are on.  They just want to make it hard.  Read the forums.  Missing huge amounts of functionality.  You have to run an external music app at the same time?  Map my ride/run/walk doesn’t.  How about delayed start?  Map my walk had that.  Nope.  Oh, and then there is the pause slop... if you stop, basically the app takes ten seconds to recognize that and does not, cannot adjust.  Lame.  I can demonstrate an easy 45-60 second based on one round trip with a five minute break at the other end.  That is, when the app is not losing my data.  It goes on and on.  How about segments just disappearing, or being marked to hazardous to record anymore.  How about the horrible horrible local legend functionality.  It’s a joke and may be meant to shame those of us that choose to ride the same routes.  Crappy application, poorly executed, very poor customer service.  Map my is free.  Use that.  Strava, I’m over you."
"Shocking customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work, wanted to give back but they refuse to refund!"
"My cycle ride with Strava Today was awful,  it did not record my cycle back home from town centre so I find Strava sometimes poor it automatic pause/restart did not restart and I took the same route from town  as I did to town, this needs looking into as to why it doesn’t work properly"
"Very inaccurate, Adds bit son you have not done, I did a walk twice on consecutive days, exactly same walk one day it told me almost 8 mile,  next day recorded just over 4 miles, huge difference in data, despoite several tickets in to support  Ihave had little or no help,"
"Downloaded the  free strava app it  doesn't do anything,  just trying to sell the premium app. Just a big con."
My runs are all flagged of a sudden. Their support is none existing and they want you to pay for this nonsense. I will stick  to my Garmin connect.
"Excellent performance but the app hcrashes too much no, put a fix on it."
Thanks for removing all the free content. Way to go on changing after years. And I thought you were different 😭
This app always gives inaccurate running distance no help at all when trying to improve running time
"All the features are paywalled It used to be better, now its scam"
Almost impossible to unsubscribe. It must be borderline legal to make it so difficult to end your subscription.
Took my money after I cancelled the plan and refuse to give it back. Awful customer service.
Lousy. Consistently fails to record distance and time. Uninstalled and reinstalled - nope. Still rubbish.
I love this app! It’s really motivated me to get outside and do more exercise.
"I am sick and tired of Strava telling me who I should give Kudos to. I don't want to see any names I don't know in the app. That is an intrusion on my privacy. People I don't know from Adam and it's telling me I should give them Kudos. Weird!  Let me get this straight, I am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to give kudos to. No way!"
Only using the free app version so far for my runs and I really like it. Its a bit of fun and has great features.  Give it a go.
"Starting june, my strava can't sync with my watch and apps..I used  Amazfit GTS..data activity can't update in my strava..PLEASE FIX IT!!!"
App doesn't work. Doesn't record runs correctly.
Just increased in price by £7!! No reason for this. No extras on the app. No need to do this
Having free option of Strava for 5 years and happy with it!!!!
The system itself is good but technical support is worthless.
"Bad terrible customer service , its a scam"
Lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. Pathetic hustle
Rubbish.  Barely records half my activities.
Just don't do it!!!  Terrible company.
strava used to awesome. Now they want money and their GPS works like crap now
Money becomes important and therefore is the app not interesting anymore
Shocking service when it comes to general enquiries. Strava uses hopeless algorithms to publish average power. My power meter and Garmin are always 10-20 watts higher on average (raw data). Have checked forums and multiple people have been asking WHY for over 2 years. Strava has failed to reply to them and me. Absolutely disgusting considering this is a paid app/account.
Utter garbage. Tried this app instead of my bike computer.Continually restarts when paused.Serious doubts about its accuracy.Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service.Get it right up you Strava.
"If you don´t want to pay for Strava, don´t use it."
"Excellent experience, accurate data, free account with already several features."
Not very useful and the suscription is expensive.
Spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. My paid account no longer exists 3 months later. Sent 3 open tickets and no response!! Dont use paid service if something goes wrong you are stuck!!!
"Happy with the overall use of the site via a PC, not so much so on the app.Good at dealing with specific enquiries on rides, but there are some long highlighted general issues that have been raised many times by different people that remain unresolved."
"Installed a week ago & I've recorded 3 walks, 1 cycle ride & my daily car commute.Only records about 50% of the route but in a straight line. Pointless piece app.Deleted today."
Stole £45 off me for a premium subscription that I didn't want. I had cancelled the subscription. They had already taken a pre-approved payment via paypal being sneaky and underhand..
"I like this app, it helped me with my running time and a bunch of other things. Wish the premium had more stuff, but overall I liked it!"
"The app and website are both riddled with bugs, despite having notifications SWITCHED off for club posts/club events/etc - I still keep getting them. Customer service couldn't help resolve it. Customer support is just VERY VERY poor. Despite sending them emails with snapshots of issues and explaining the problems in detail in the email, they seem to IGNORE anything but the subject line of the email and reply with a typical template response which is absolutely USELESS. Recently Strava tried to be 'smart' and messed up with privacy settings so that now you need to set them to 'everyone' to get counted towards monthly challenges. It is absolutely RIDICULOUS as to why would everyone want to reveal their whereabouts/ activity routes to EVERYONE on Strava?!?!?!?! Previously the privacy settings, even when sent to 'followers', would allow you to be counted towards monthly activity challenges.Poor, poor, POOR."
Completely useless customer service. I've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! Come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. Why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan
Can't create segments despite paying for  premium Strava. Error ''you are not allowed to access that page'  contacted Strava and got an utterley bizaar reply from their support team with no solution. Also trying to create s route on a map is near impossible I know my route but Strave just wants to change it. Its much easier to stick with Garmin Connect if you have a Garmin device.
Great website for tracking fitness activities. They could do with more premium features for runners. The site seems very geared towards cyclists.
"Paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! You lost me to the new viral scale on tik tok that comes with a FREE app to scan and log your intake as well as your MACROS which you also hide away unless you pay an arm and a leg. Get outta here my fitness pal, DO BETTER. "
MyFitnessPal has improved over the years simplifying their platform to help with food and exercise journaling.  One piece I like is when MyFitnessPal has added SMTWTFS buttons to use if you know that you will be eating the same food again.  It makes my time spent journaling even less. 
"I used to really like this app; not so much anymore.  Losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me.  Also, the app occasionally features a ridiculous amount of pop-up ads (which is why I stopped using it for a long time).  They had a great product; now it is just ""okay""."
"I have used for 1,240 without a break. Obviously I am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. I am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. In this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden, even cooking; otherwise there is a mismatch between predicted and actual weight. Annoyingly of late, the App is now frequently asking me to log back in, which looses it a star. Why has this been changed?"
"I really love this app, its helped me loose 50 lbs so far, by calorie counting alone. I still have about 100-150lbs to go & this app as been absolutely instrumental to my success. It's super easy to use & I don't think I'd be so successful without it.I do only use the app to count my calories, & haven't really used any of the other features.I do miss being able to scan a barcode & pull up a product's nutritional info. That used to be a free feature. & unfortunately, I just can't afford to pay for the subscription. That is the only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 5.Still love the app, & if I could afford the anual fee, I would absolutely pay for it!!!"
"It's a great app, with information that can help people through any type of fitness journey. It's only downfall and it's a miniscule issue to be honest is that the premium version is quite expensive for what it offers. All in all a really good app and well worth a try if you're trying to lose weight, build muscle or just track your calories and exercise."
I have found MyFitnessPal to be a good replacement brand W which is very expensive.  The data base is not as robust for non-food activity but overall is helpful.  The program works well on my phone and laptop but is glitchy on my tablet.  I have reported the issue (app closes after an entry) but after six months there still is no resolution
"This is a very simple App by which I mean to use, but which allows access to a great amount data in order to track your diet and physical training. Going the paid route opens up so much more and this is both insightful and in my case, helps motivate me. "
I really do like MFP but the inputs are not accurate. You'll put in a food and get multiple answers with calories that are polar opposite of each other. It should be governed better because it's just not that accurate anymore.
"I find the menu easy to navigate, and the info on calories and nutrients is very helpful. However, the search function in “Add a Food” has some incorrect calorie counts. Also, the system automatically adds my exercise calories to my daily total. I can’t opt out of that without upgrading to premium. The functions available for free are great, though."
"What made my experience great is the fact that I can track my calories, I have been using MyFitnessPal for many years and I had bariatric surgery 3 years ago and this is a very handy tool to use to track.  What I used to like I was able to scan my food for free. However now I write my food in because for scanning it isn't free anymore but, I still like tracking calories even though I write them in."
"I've been using this site for many years with so many useful tips and information, track my weight, calories,get recipes. The benefits are endless and the cost is NOTHING! "
"Absolutely an essential part of my life now. MyFitnessPal has become my de facto way of keeping track of calories. Its accurate, extremely easy to use and would be difficult to do without."
Great tool to track calories and syncs with other apps. I lost 7 stone using the app and maintained my weight by tracking calories in and calories out. Thanks for such a fantastic resource. 
"As someone who needs to closely monitor intake of carbs and protein, the app has been invaluable for me. It's so great to be able to log meals while in the go and keep track of how I am ""doing"" in every area of my dietary intake. Being able to take advantage of barcodes is an amazingly quick way to enter food into my log as is having so many restaurant menus loaded into the app for easy entry. Finally, the app keeps me conscious of the what I am eating as well as the nutritive value for everything I choose. Without the app I wouldn't have the glucose control that I have and wouldn't be meeting other nutrition goals that I and my dietician have set for me."
I’ve been using this app for over a year now bc it makes food journaling easy!  I’ve used other apps & found them time-consuming so my use wasn’t consistent. I appreciate the notifications throughout the day to log my meals. 
"MyFitnessPal is my right hand through my weight loss and nutrition journey.  The food database is huge and being able to access a particular restaurant chain's nutrition really sets them apart.  I set my own nutrition goals in the app to match what my doctor suggested and I pull reports to see how my daily intake of calories, protein, or whatever are impacting my weight.  It's a great app and for all that I use it daily, there are many more features available that I haven't tapped yet. (e.g. fitness tracking)"
Great; really helps me to see the macro distribution. It's super easy to look up the foods I have either by the search bar or barcode. I'd like to see more nutrients/minerals in the nutrient breakdown tab. Also less ads would be nice. 
You took almost all the features that away(ie feed and  barcode) I don’t even log anymore because you made it a paid feature to use the barcode scan
"My Fitness Pal is a strong ap for caloric counting, food entry ad understanding your categories of food intake.  (Carbs, proteins etc.)  The barcode scan feature is great and USED to be free.  There are limited articles on the dashboard - there used to be easily accessible articles and videos.  All that being said, there are so many great features there relating to diet, exercise, motivational groups etc.  It is a fairly robust overall health tracking app.  You just have to work wor it a little more and pay for some of the features.  I wonder if they are sacrificing usability for the sake of complexity?  I still access it everyday but only for 2-3 things.  "
"I like the ability to customize with macros, to be able to scan barcodes to log food, to put in recipes and have it calculate everything for you. What I don't like is the fact that it goes based upon a deficit system that doesn't take him to accountpeoples make up. It would be better if we use the system that didn't tell us we only needed to eat 1200 cal because that actually promotes eating disorders. That shouldn't be the status quo. There should be an option.  Peoples make up. It would be better if we use the system that didn't tell us we only needed to eat 1200 cal because that actually promotes eating disorders. That shouldn't be the status quo. There should be an option to use different macro develops systems on the free version. "
I love using this app. Super easy and it keeps me on track. I love the new beta for the weekly wrap up of my foods logged most and how many times. Makes me push to get those extra veggies in if need.My only complaint is there is so much of the same items logged in and all the nutrition values don’t match up. I’m using this mostly for health issues and seeing a food that is 300g of sodium being logged in as 900g can be frustrating. I totally get you can police every one. Thanks for a wonderful app!
"I’ve used MFP for many years. I love how it helps keep me on track. I also love how the database has so many foods already there, saving me the trouble of calculating them individually."
This app is by far much better than others of this type.  The articles that are also included in the app are informative and interesting.My only complaints are that I find some of the diary information inaccurate and that the premium content isn't worth the premium price.
MyFitnessPal has been my go to app for tracking my macros and staying on top of my nutrition.  Definitely intend to keep using this app as I continue my health/wellness journey. 
"Been using this app for years, often see people asking for any other similar apps (I guess there are a few) but MFP works perfectly for me. I’m very happy "
"I struggle with MyFitnessPal on a regular basis, although I use it religiously. It frequently does not sync information with my computer to my phone. I have not found a better choice."
"This App has a very extensive data base so makes it easy to track my daily food intake,  It has really helped me with portion control"
App works great.  Lots of matches in the database.  Accessing premium features such as nutrients and macros is very helpful
"I don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. I also have a new fitness tracker (uses Glory Fit app) and Fitness Pal does not integrate with it. I really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan."
"I’ve been using MyFitnesPal for 8-1/2 years, with no real problems. The only reason for a 4-Star rating and not a 5-Star rating is that the very useful barcode scanning feature that was free for many years is no longer included in the free version. Now you have to purchase the premium product in order to use it. "
"Love the app! It’s helped me lose weight, eat better, exercise more, reach my goals and stay on track/maintain. Great database for tracking food at meals, integration of data to/from other health apps and devices, nice goal setting/tracking features. The periodic emails can also have interesting articles and recipes."
Being able to keep track of my eating and drinking is easy to do with the MyFitnessPal app.  I use both the phone app and log-in via computer.  Very convenient.
"Crashes frequently. No longer tracks GPS & mileage accurately. Premium feature adverts are too frequent & full screen. Been this way for years now, but steadily gets worse every update/year. "
Comprehensive library of foods. Helpful tips. Seamless integration with related apps. Would be nice if all food portions had an option to enter by weight. 
"My fitness pal is a brilliant app for managing everything linked to a healthy lifestyle. It is easy to use and if you subscribe to the premium service then you get fantastic value for money additions. I personally use the basic service for free as my only requirement is the food diary. You will not be disappointed using My Fitness Pal, and I will guarantee that."
"Without the newsfeed it’s just a food diary, too many nutters in the ‘community’ areas so I won’t use them.."
"A great app, which is simple to use but gives very useful results.    Integrates with my Garmin watch, to give complete tracking. "
"Great app to track your calories and workouts! Searching for food, it is a very thorough and complete database and very easy to find what you need for quick logins.  Also, the ability to make and save recipes is a great asset to the app!"
"Long time user of myfitnesspal. Overall I like the app. I like how I can sync it with my Polar H9 and Samsung Health.  I just don't like how they took away barcode scan and made it only available to ""premium"" users. I personally feel like that's a tactic to try to make it inconvenient for people who don't care about the ""premium"" features to try and force them to pay for it! Everything shouldn't always be about profit all the time!"
"MyFitnessPal has helped me lose 10 pounds and keep it off for over 10 years. I gave up on low-carb diets and just track calories in and calories out. When I can't find a food in their huge database, I can enter my recipe and the app calculates calories and nutrients for me.  The app subtracts calories burned by exercise after I select from the long list of activities or use an integrated tracker on my phone to Map my Ride or Walk. To estimate how many calories I need per day to maintain my weight with NO exercise, I used one of the online calculators of Basal Metabolic Rate (which depends on height, weight, and age). It's been incredibly accurate. Even though my BMR is under 1200 calories per day, I can eat more than my BMR target and I don't gain weight because I get some exercise. It's as simple as that. MyFitnessPal also helps me get better nutrition by showing me how close I am to recommended requirements for important nutrients. This app has probably added many healthy years to my life, and I'm grateful!"
"When they removed the ""scan the barcode"" to ID your grocery food for the basic app, that's when I marked it down. I waste so MUCH time ""searching"" for a particular food. It's aggravating. I don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. Other than that, I have always liked My Fitness Pal. "
It's generally a good app to keep track of your calories. They took away the scanning of items in the free version and put that in the premium version. That move disappointed me. I understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. I've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$$$$$ hungry
Scanning barcodes used to be free makes the entire app pointless if they gatekeep easy way to track what you eat
"I love MyFitness Pal!  It has helped me to lose 18 pounds and keep it off!  It helps me be accountable for my choices!  Today is my 1,825th consecutive day of using MFP!!!! A very satisfied customer!"
Brilliant bar code facility. Would love if it was possible to duplicate items for multiple meals and days but other than that very user friendly. 
I've been using this app to track workouts and meals for years. It's never disappointed and I trust its data more than any other app I've used. It's also intuitive and integrates with other apps. No complaints.
It’s app is easy to use and they everything imaginable listed! I still use the free app and am tempted to try the updated version.
A very large database of food.  Easy to set up recipes and meals.  Can follow macros and daily nutrient requirements.  
Been using this app for years. It’s been a wonderful tool in my weight loss journey (50 lbs.!) and in helping me maintain my weight loss.
Disappointed that features that were free when I started using the app now cost money. Original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. 
amazing app! I've had for 3 years and it's been of invaluable help with my bulking and cutting bodybuilding cycles. Simply love it
I’ve used this as a valuable tool to track my calories for the past 8 years. It’s very user friendly and a big part of keeping me accountable. This app is great! 
"It has been great app. The measurements for the food is helpful, because u can change them to what you know to make it easy. I like that u can put exercises in too. It helps to keep track of the days I exercise, all in one app."
"I find the fitness pal app very helpful reaching my macro goals, weight loss and exercise recording .Love the app for my needs."
I have been using MyFitnessPal for many years to journal my daily foods. It is such a helpful resource in helping to be mindful of what we eat on a daily basis. 
I am a long term user and love how easy it is to log my foods and progress on MyFitnessPal! Informative guides are a wonderful plus
It’s a great app that helps you stay healthy by tracking your food intake and offers a lot of helpful recipes
"I have used this website for several years.  It is great for me to be able to watch my calories.  There are lots of very helpful recipes, great ideas for exercises and a lot of helpful advice by qualified professionals.  I definitely recommend this website."
"On the most part, MyFitnessPal is right on. Always room for improvement, especially for people who don't eat processed food. Having to continually put in ingredients I choose to eat is somewhat challenging, especially since I often substitute the alternative ingredients in recipes. "
"It's a great app. I'm amazed by how many foods are in the data bank. If the food I want is not there, I can usually find one similar. The posted columns are very useful and helpful. I especially like the recipes."
"Fitness Pal is easy to use, to check my daily nutrients (calories, carbs, fiber, etc). Most of my meal choices are already included in the data. I like the menu items that give a greater variety.  I check throughout the day to see where I am with Protein, carbs and calories.  It keeps me on track."
I find your site to be usable. I especially like being able to access it from multiple devices. I also like the extensive data base of nutritional information for various foods.
"On the basic level customers can't get blood pressure, heartbeat etc on the app"
Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items.  I do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version.
MyFitnessPal has all the features I need to manage my diet and support my overall fitness goals. I use it daily.
Love how it helps me stay on track. My heart doctor really loves it because it helps him know I am eating he’s. Recipe are great. Micros are great. 
Good selection of foods without having to read Biar codes.  Reminders to step on the scales.
"It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. Great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what I'm eating "
"I use MFP to track my weight and calories, and it has helped me achieve my fitness goals through the years. "
"It is a really good app, shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of Premium for a pensioner is a little steep."
"I've been using My Fitness Pal since 2021 and tracking calories, finding the foods to enter,tracking water intake and entering your weight has been very user friendly with the My Fitness Pal app"
"It’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the UPC - only accessible via the paid app. That was a greedy move. "
This app has been a game changer! I love the premium option so I can modify my macros and also be able to get detailed info on my nutrients!
I use it about a couple year ago and now i know how to control my food calories.
I pay extra to get carb counts by meal to determine insulin need.  I use it 3 times a day.  
Easy ti use and upload myfeedback which was welcomed by the company I bought from who rewarded me with free gift 
They took away the bar code scanner. Now have to pay ridiculous amount just to use a feature that was free before. 
I love using MyFitnessPal.  I have been using it for about 10 years now I love being able to watch my eternal yo-yo dieting.
"Easy to use, great reminder or the calories you use each day"
Fitness pal is excellent for tracking your diet and fitness to keep you on track
I use this everyday. I just wish I could import recipes from other apps. 
I love the app but missing a few important vitamins.  Magnesium and d.  also I hate you have to pay to scan
"I have used MFP daily for years. It serves as ""guardrails"" for my weight loss journey and for maintenance once I reach my goal."
"April 25I sent you the letter below weeks ago, but you must not have received it since I received no acknowledgement. For what it is worth, I will allow the renewal to go through, but I expect to pay more for poor, sub-standard service.I would not recommend your app to anyone without reservations. Your app is not friendly to seniors nor to people with limited manual dexterity.April 5, 2024A few months ago, you had your users fill out an online survey. I expect the rates will go up when I renew my subscription based upon the questions asked. What you did NOT ask was what I, as a user, valued. You did provide a list of pre-approved values but did not ask about anything NOT on the list.I use your mobile app to enter my meals and exercise, but it is NOT useful for me to do anything else. I primarily use your website on my desktop. The website is NOT user friendly.On the smart phone, I have found the app doesn’t always “remember” foods I have used in the past. When entering foods for meals, the “frequently paired foods” offers foods I haven’t eaten in 3 years and “forgets” what I ate 2 days ago. It can’t remember the most frequently used entry. And the sort order isn’t useful either. The most frequently used items are nowhere near the top.In the exercise section I have it set to sort by most recently used, but it sorts randomly. I do one exercise 3-4 times per week, but that is at the bottom of the menu, no matter how many times I set the sort order to “most frequent”. Exercises I seldom use are at the top.The app also nags. I do not need a nanny. Don’t nag about grams fat, protein, carbs, sodium, etc. When I complete the diary, I do not need a nag about how much I would weigh if I continued to eat & exercise the same. I do NOT use your app for weight loss. I have turned all the nagging off.Your app requires use of expensive devices for tracking steps & diabetes management. It does not allow me to enter steps taken with a device that is not connected to the internet. It does not allow me to manage my diabetes without an expensive blood glucose monitor connected to the internet.On the website: I have been a paid subscriber since 2018. I use the website at least 4 times per week, mostly planning my week’s menus. I use the recipe maker extensively to add or modify existing recipes. The database to look up ingredients is a “mess”! For instance: looking up ground cumin (a spice) 1 teaspoonful is either 0 calories; 88 calories; 125 calories; 16 calories or 9 calories. For the record, I looked up the USDA nutritional information for ground cumin and found that for 1 teaspoon the calorie range is between 8 and 9 calories.Trying to look up previously entered recipe in your database is challenging. It is very time consuming to find a recipe previously entered into “Your Recipe Box”. I must search page by page on the website to find the recipe I need to edit. I have over 49 pages to search to find the recipe I am seeking. The Recipe Box cannot be sorted or searched by key words.I have also recently discovered that if I copy a meal from a previous entry, delete one of the foods and add another, the app helpfully re-adds that food (the one I deleted) back in. I recently found it re-added a food 5 times on the previous day. I didn’t discover that until I tried to copy that meal into today’s log. 5 TIMES!!!I have also noticed that your “Help Desk” does not want to interact with customers. I don’t want to CHAT! I would rather send an email explaining the problem and receive a reply. I don’t contact Help often, only when I can’t find an answer by trying to navigate your Byzantine help Q&A. I got nothing useful asking about the app duplicating entries.Your survey asked what value added features I would consider a “Must Have”. A searchable “Your Recipe Box” is it.Respectfully,"
"Love using this app to track my calories, macros and daily steps. It helps to motivate me hit my targets "
I have been using this wonderful app for over 10 years. It has helped me lose and maintain weight. I like to be able to see how I am doing on a daily basis with my nutrition. Thank you. 
This haskell me on track fir more than 2 yes. I like that I can check and see what something is calorie wise.
Love the app and have used it daily for over 5 years. For five stars give us the option to make the diary the default page!  
It help me keep my daily food journal and keeping up with calories per day.
"Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight"
"Everything works really well on the my fitness pal app, it's worth using for free and buys a subscription "
The app is easy to use and perfect for managing my fitness goals.
I don't like that I can no longer scan bar codes without paying.  I am currently trying different apps.
I’ve been using my fitness pal for a long time. Everything is fine but I do miss the scan for calories part. That is the reason for the 4️⃣ stars only. Thank you 😊 
I love the app and it kept me on track for years. It's definitely a good tool to use to keep yourself accountable.
Excellent App. Taught me well about macro nutrition facts. 
I have always enjoyed myfitnesspal and used it for years but will eventually find something else if they continue to take away features that had always been free before and make them premium 
"A really good app simply made for help, it has helped me on my way of losing 38 pounds in about 3 months!"
"It's a big asset in the fitness journey of any individual if used correctly, I've been using it consistently for past 2 months and I'm literally seeing the results on weekly basis."
"Always very helpful knowing how many calories are consumed each day, thank you."
"Tracking my food and nutritional values has led me to lose 95 lbs. I feel great, too!"
I'm able to see what I'm eating.  I can decide what and how much to eat. This way I can keep my calories in the range that I want it to be.
This app keeps me accountable and provides insightful information that helps me improve my nutritional habits.
Used for years!!  Great for calorie counting and keeping track of my nutrition values. 
"This app makes it easy to track food, exercise and macros.  I have been using this app daily for over a year."
"The workout feature is hit and miss, but basically it works well"
"The breadth, diversity and usefulness of the offerings are essential tools on any fitness/weight loss journey."
I have been using MyFitnessPal for over five years to track the foods I have eaten everyday. Love it!
Absolutely brilliant app that tracks my calories. This app is the only way I can lose weight.
Very helpful and easy to use for tracking food and weight. “Things that you measure tend to get better!”
Locking the barcode scanner behind a paywall was a weak move
Other options available at much less cost
"I love how easy it is to use, keeping track of calories is so simple!"
It a very good app. I am up for renewal but will not renew…79.00 😬
Dislike that they took away the scanning of the barcodes. I’m not paying for that.
I have been using My Fitness Pal for 12 years and nothing else can beat it!
It’s easy to communicate with other bikers in the community and share experiences.
I love it bc it’s accurate on helping me to keep track of my calories 
My fitness pal helps me be accountable for what I eat and that helps. 
great app easy to use and excellent for daily use.
Brings awareness on logging foods .
I've been using MyFitnessPal for 
"Keeps you on track for calories, carbs etc"
I like the articles and suggested challenge. 
Very easy to use extensive list of foods. 
It’s always been helpful 
"Steps are not updated, some days it records 0."
It's easy to track my meals and keep my nutrition on track. 
So far the app has helped me lose 18 IbsBrilliant 
Too many options not easy to find same foods on web as it is the app. I use both daily.
It is easy to log your foods.  The ability to repeat is good.
Easy to use and barcode scanning is a life saver!
Great app. Easy to use. Has info on many foods and restaurants. 
Too many ads on the free version. Takes up 1/3 of the screen 
I’ve lost 25 lbs in last year and a half using it. 
Best app so far. Been using for many years
This app is simple to use and really helps me stay on track.
Been a fan for longtime..... Great app great product

Tracking calories helps with keeping yourself accountable.
Very easy to use and add your stuff. 
This is a great app and helps me daily 
It's great to keep me on track with food.

It keeps you healthy 
Thanks so much 
Used this for years. Fantastic
"My Fitness pal is used for more than just weight loss!  I have had sigificant medical issues, had been put on a non amylose diet. I used MFP to make sure i was getting enough calories. When i started the diet you have to eat alot, most foods are low calorie. My husband suggested i start using it as i was feeling bad and he thought i might not be getting enough calories. He was right, i plugged in the foods and i was only eating 700 calories. I used the app to plan out the whole day to get enough calories, then figured out the right number to lose weight. Using this app i lost 38 pounds since january of 2024. Also had a problem with my stomach and had to use a liquid diet for 2 weeks. I was able to see the nutrition and the calories. Learned my sodium was too low on the app and added salt. Im still losing weight want to be 140, am very close now. Will continue to use the app for nutrition info when i maintain my weight and if i start gaining will cut calories back to lose the extra and maintain my weight! Thank you My Fitness Pal!!"
Company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features
My trainer Arman at 24 our Fitness set this app up for me so that I could track my progress. It has been amazing how helpful it has been.
You do help me track my calories. Disappointed that the scan option isn’t available anymore.
"I believe that they keep updating and adding more food choices, thus making it easier to find my food choices. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because they took away the scan feature and now one has to pay for it."
Helping me maintain weight goals
"It's fine for tracking calories. I dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. One second it's 0, then 400, then 258. It's very glitchy."
Using MFP without purchasing premium worked but. I love my premium subscription is the best. I have lost like 25 pounds in a couple months by logging everything I eat. I am working with a professional nutritionist who recommended using it. And I use it religiously. I use it as a tool to help me.
I love My Fitness Pal! First thing I use daily to help plan my nutritional goals 
Ridiculous to navigate and inaccurate 
"Super app , using it to loose 6 stone and without it I'd be lost , it's a app for life ."
Keeps me on track 
"I’m a long time user and credit My Fitness Pal with providing both information and the discipline needed to first lose weight and then maintain. I have many friends who complain about not being able to lose weight but have no clue about how many calories, carbs, fats etc they consume. Additionally they don’t understand how few calories are actually needed by the human body per day or the amount of exercise needed per day to burn excess calories, fat intake, etc. My Fitness Pal initial provided a convenient way to measure the elements of food intake and learn to understand the caloric, fat and nutritional value of foods. That led to reducing fats and calories and improving nutrition. That led to developing daily exercise routines. The combination led to a dramatic reduction in weight, lowered cholesterol, and vastly improved overall nutrition and general health. I’ve maintained my weight +/- five pounds for over 10 years. If there’s anything I’ve learned it’s that I eat to live rather that live to eat. "
"You help me stay on track, easy to use"
"This app has been crucial to me counting calories, calculating my TDEE, and keeping me on track with my daily nutrition. I have seen astronomical results regarding my overall well-being and weight loss! I was recently diagnosed with gallbladder and liver issues, and myfitnesspal has made it much easier to visualize if I’m achieving my macro and nutrient goals for those conditions. With their premium features, it has been worth it! It makes it so much easier for me to log foods with a barcode, to track macros, and quick-add foods I eat regularly. It has been all over a positive experience. At first, I thought the price was a little steep for premium, but when considering your health, it’s a small price to pay. Even without premium, the app is extremely beneficial! I’m very grateful for my fitness pal keeping me on track! (The community and recipes made available are also very, very nice!)"
I like to see if I go over in what areas it is and I am more mindful of my food choices and activities 
Helps me track my calories & macronutrients perfectly!
"The ability to find specific foods from stores and restaurants makes it easy to do your daily check in. Another great feature is the bar code reader, meaning less typing.  The wide range of brands and food names is impressive.I also like the articles on recipes and nutritional information, and sometimes I try to make the dishes.My fitness pal helped me to get down to my current weight and stay there for several years."
Taking away the newsfeed was one of the most boneheaded business moves I’ve seen in some time. Bring back the news feed and the ability to put a picture with each newsfeeds post. This isn’t rocket science. I won’t be renewing if stays like this. I’ve been there 12 years. Every day 
The data base is comprehensive. I like being able to see macros and nutrients.  I like seeing weight after 5 weeks if you copy the day. 
Been using the app for years.  Hopefully they won’t make too many changes
The searchable database makes accurate recording of calories very easy.  The link to my Fitbit step counter helps track calories burned.  Now I know why my weight is stuck in place.
Most of the time I can find what I eat but sometimes I can't find a specific recipe.  I cook from Ketofocus a lot since my family is diabetic and keto meals help with blood sugars. 
Giving me an idea of what I’m eating and how much I am eating. 
I love keeping track of my calorie intake.
Lots of food options with relevant nutritional information 
I love being able to track my meals and I appreciate being able to view the nutrition consumed. I wish the option to scan barcodes was not taken away from the basic package. It is not crippling enough to make me want to purchase Premium. 
"I love logging my food.  I live on social security,  so spending the money for premium is out of the question for me.  I don't like that you took things away (example: scanning in a product barcode) and made it premium.   An upgrade should be an upgrade,  not paying for things that used to be free!! I use the program every day and have lost a total of 148 lbs.  Helps keep me accountable-good or not so good alike!"
Very good  user friendly Helpful too 
"I love this app. However, they took away ability to scan. It's part of the yearly subscription which should offer more. "
I love MyFitnessPal. It is so simply and easy to use. I just started back using it and can't wait to continue on my health and fitness goals and journey!
The app is easy to use and allows me to track my calories effortlessly 
Beautiful product with many options to assess your meals
"I started using the app after a heart attack. I use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. It's great,and their database has many foods. The Pro version has many features I don't need. But you may find it useful. It's definitely worth a look."
Good to count calories and keep trsvk. Expensive to go premium 
"I do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. And also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories on that meal. Its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing "
"I'm very disappointed in the end of NewsFeed. It was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. I know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support, after years of building relationships. "
"Great app, keeps me honest!"
Really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. Data that's not tracked is not managed.
"Functionality is great and relatively user friendly. The database often has any food I need. I rarely need to add a food. The app helps me track my macros, so I can keep my protein and fat high and carbs low. I've kept the extra weight off for 5 years now. "
I like that I can scan food to get the nutrition info. I started the South Beach diet at my Dr’s recommendation and found it hard to find information within the app to follow it.  I’ve only been a paid user for two weeks now but I would like a little more intelligent personalization built in. 
Not syncing consistently with my Fitbit app. The free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. The nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. I want to see the individual nutrients 
I’ve been using MyFitnessPal for five years now and enjoy using it to track my food intake. I highly recommend it.
"What a piece of crap! Been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. It takes over a minute to load and most things are missing. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling so now it's goodbye to myfitnesspal. Dunno what went wrong but it's them, not me."
"MyFitnessPal is amazing! It has been a huge help in my weight loss journey. The food database is huge, and the barcode scanner makes logging meals super easy. It tracks my progress and syncs with my other fitness apps. It's kept me motivated and on track. Highly recommend for anyone looking to get healthier!"
"I have used the free version for years, with no complaints. And it synchronises with f.x. mapmyrun.I have input my own table consisting of the most common foods for me. The ""recent"" and ""frequent"" lists are not updating consistently but it is still usable."
£15.99 for such a useless app that I used probably once and forgot all about! With no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy so that when you do get charged you can’t get your money back. What a scam!Update:I’ve been able to get a refund my apple directly.
"I’ve been building my history since the beginning of the year. Last week while on holiday my entire history went blank.So I messaged them. Their response was to ask for my username and email, so I told them. Long story short, 9 days later and they still haven’t looked into my account or the problem. Now anything I input just doesn't save.The customer service is simply non-existent. I've paid for a food and exercise diary. They haven't been able to provide this or respond to my queries."
"Used my fitness pal for years on and off…Just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.What was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all "
Be very careful when you subscribe for annual package. If yiy switch phone they won't honor it they blame it on apple Very dissatisfied customerDarlene Sholley
Impossible to contact them & their BOT is useless
"I have thousands of entries saved in their weight tracker from many years of usage but now that I want to try other apps, they're holding my data hostage unless I pay £15 for access to the export feature. If they have any faith in their product, they shouldn't need to make it so difficult to try other options.... Despicable"
Unable to contact them after I was alerted to my details being put out on the dark web connected directly to them. Reporting them to ombudsman
"After not using the app for a few months, (after using it for years), I returned to it to discover that I can no longer scan a barcode on, say, a loaf of bread without signing up for their premium service. What a joke! I won’t be using this app again. So long, MFP!"
