after having 2 fitbits changed under warranty now google has taken them over they are not quite as helpful.don't buy a fitbit if you want to swim in the sea with it as it appears that you cannot.this is despite fitbit suggesting that the watch can go down to as far as 50m  in water. it does not state anywhere that this does not apply in the sea.in fact i would not be surprised if it would last that long in a swimming pool either.note that what it does say in small print is that the water seal deteriates over time and therefore you won't get any any joy if your watch stops working after a year.after 3 watches wrecked after swimming in the sea and bringing this to their attention it rely is time that on their discription it should say cannot be worn in the sea! ,fitbits changed warranty google taken quite buy fitbit want swim sea appears despite fitbit suggesting watch go far water state anywhere apply fact would surprised would last long swimming pool say small print water seal deteriates time therefore wo get joy watch stop working watch wrecked swimming sea bringing attention rely time discription say worn sea,NEGATIVE,,fitbits changed warranty google taken quite buy fitbit want swim sea appears despite fitbit suggesting watch go far water state anywhere apply fact would surprised would last long swimming pool say small print water seal deteriates time therefore wo get joy watch stop working watch wrecked swimming sea bringing attention rely time discription say worn sea,neutral,

"i had a fitbit inspire 2 which you could only read in a fully darkened room. finally got through to customer service late afternoon who asked that i go into settings on the devise whilst it was charging. this was impossible as you couldn't read the screen, so was asked to send a photo (?) in response to an email they would send. i had to go out so said i would do this in the morning, which i did at 07.30. the email said that the case was closed but could be reopened by responding to the email, which i did -twice, with no further response; so much for customer service. this was the 2nd fitbit which i had problems with, there won't be another!",fitbit inspire could read fully darkened room finally got customer service late afternoon asked go setting devise whilst charging impossible could read screen asked send photo response email would send go said would morning email said case closed could reopened responding email response much customer service fitbit problem wo another,NEGATIVE,,fitbit inspire could read fully darkened room finally got customer service late afternoon asked go setting devise whilst charging impossible could read screen asked send photo response email would send go said would morning email said case closed could reopened responding email response much customer service fitbit problem wo another,neutral,
had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. fitbit has lost me as a customer.  there must be better products out there.  ,fitbit sense year went swimming time watch time watch failed last fitbit also lasted year fitbit lost customer must better product,NEGATIVE,,fitbit sense year went swimming time watch time watch failed last fitbit also lasted year fitbit lost customer must better product,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
fitbit is definitely not worth the money. buy any other watch. i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that and no replacement available. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. so i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. half of the features quit working at 6 months. i wish i had not wasted my money.,fitbit definitely worth money buy watch bought first fitbit got really use using text notification quit working year one would could help fix replacement available decided fluke everything slowly quit working charging time painful bought charge november worst decision long time many issue customer service help forcing use google really stink half feature quit working month wish wasted money,NEGATIVE,,fitbit definitely worth money buy watch bought first fitbit got really use using text notification quit working year one would could help fix replacement available decided fluke everything slowly quit working charging time painful bought charge november worst decision long time many issue customer service help forcing use google really stink half feature quit working month wish wasted money,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable.

Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
i find that fitbit is not worth the money.  they are programmed to fail.  i have the fitbit luxe. it just randomly shuts down.  my friend had the same issue. she recently bought a new fitbit. it's already having problems.  i will never buy another one.  i've worn fitbit for years.  i just don't have the money to throw away on a crap product. ,find fitbit worth money programmed fail fitbit luxe randomly shuts friend issue recently bought new fitbit already problem never buy another one worn fitbit year money throw away crap product,NEGATIVE,,find fitbit worth money programmed fail fitbit luxe randomly shuts friend issue recently bought new fitbit already problem never buy another one worn fitbit year money throw away crap product,disapproval,
"used to be such a great company from which we purchased multiple smart watches, but since their acquisition every single functionality of these devices has been poor. there is no new content, no new watch faces, no new apps meanwhile the competitors have all the cool stuff.",used great company purchased multiple smart watch since acquisition every single functionality device poor new content new watch face new apps meanwhile competitor cool stuff,NEGATIVE,,used great company purchased multiple smart watch since acquisition every single functionality device poor new content new watch face new apps meanwhile competitor cool stuff,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry.

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
"horrifically poor company. my fitbit versa 2 began to fail after 18 months, so i contacted fitbit customer services to seek help as the watch has a two year warranty. i’ve tried contacting fitbit twice over the last month and nobody has bothered to acknowledge either of my emails. i tried to raise this as a formal complaint as the watch is getting progressively worse and the warranty period is running out, only to find they have no official complaints procedure. the warranty is absolutely useless if nobody is there to fix an issue when it presents. i don’t know how such an established business is allowed to operate like this with no accountability. when i inevitably have to replace this watch at my own expense, i will definitely go to a competitor who can be trusted to honour a warranty.

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"
second time my fitbit charge 5 has stopped responding since purchase. first time they sent a new one with no problem but that has failed now. this time they refuse to refund and only to exchange (been down this path before) plus they want me to send mine back and wait two weeks for a replacement to be shipped. ,second time fitbit charge stopped responding since purchase first time sent new one problem failed time refuse refund exchange path plus want send mine back wait two week replacement shipped,NEGATIVE,,second time fitbit charge stopped responding since purchase first time sent new one problem failed time refuse refund exchange path plus want send mine back wait two week replacement shipped,neutral,

fantastic app for monitoring my sleep and improving my wellness,fantastic app monitoring sleep improving wellness,POSITIVE,fantastic app monitoring sleep improving wellness,,admiration,"Fitbit app used to be excellent. it is in decline unless you pay their monthly subscription! i paid £400 for a piece of tech and can only use its full potential if i keep paying! you can shove it fitbit, no doubt you are making fortunes using all the data you have on us too! i used to love my fitbit and have been a loyal customer for over a decade. the app was always great, simple to use, easy to read, good to see how you were doing over time. recently the app changed but the underlying sections remained usable, now the sleep app has been “updated” it is unusable. we comment but fitbit are ignoring us, time to look at other offerings. Sleep tracking is excellent, easy to use with a simple to learn ui. battery life is brilliant, last several days! superb fitness trackers with a very competitive prices. charge 5 worked perfectly and now i am on charge 6, which is just as good with a minor improvements, all adds up to very smooth user experience. great app for cyclists! it's my every day app for recording my sports activities. the segments feature is super addictive. no problem to pay 59 usd per year for it. keep up the good job by continuously adding features! great product and social experience with a positive effect. Each email takes 3-5 working days to get a response, and in my case the support agent took two of those emails to ask the same question twice (adding 10 days to the resolution) it took weeks to resolve a basic problem. a few months back i started tracking my walks. i do 2 miles a day minimum, and just being able to see all the data set me on my journey to lose weight and get fitter. i now use strava, and garmin app together. very good app. i can build my cycling routes easily and also share them with my fellow-cyclists. strava can connect with multiple cycling computers even those that are sold on aliexpress. which makes it easier to follow the routes i build in the strava app. i have been using strava for nearly 3 years. it's great an compatible with my apple watch. i have rated it 4 stars because the have removed feature, making them ""summit"" (premium) features. i use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great. excellent performance but the app hcrashes too much no, put a fix on it. only using the free app version so far for my runs and i really like it.  give it a go. Great website for tracking fitness activities. they could do with more premium features for runners. the site seems very geared towards cyclists. it's a great app, with information that can help people through any type of fitness journey. i appreciate the notifications throughout the day to log my meals. it's super easy to look up the foods i have either by the search bar or barcode. i'd like to see more nutrients/minerals in the nutrient breakdown tab. also less ads would be nice. App has helped me lose weight, eat better, exercise more, reach my goals and stay on track/maintain. great database for tracking food at meals, integration of data to/from other health apps and devices, nice goal setting/tracking features. Great app to track your calories and workouts! searching for food, it is a very thorough and complete database and very easy to find what you need for quick logins. The ability to make and save recipes is a great asset to the app! i've had for 3 years and it's been of invaluable help with my bulking and cutting bodybuilding cycles. brilliant bar code facility. would love if it was possible to duplicate items for multiple meals and days but other than that very user friendly. i’ve used this as a valuable tool to track my calories for the past 8 years. i like that u can put exercises in too. it helps to keep track of the days i exercise, all in one app. i'm amazed by how many foods are in the data bank. if the food i want is not there, i can usually find one similar. the posted columns are very useful and helpful. i especially like the recipes. It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what i'm eating. shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of premium for a pensioner is a little steep. Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight excellent app. taught me well about macro nutrition facts. it’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the upc - only accessible via the paid app. that was a greedy move. This app has helped me on my way of losing 38 pounds in about 3 months! tracking my food and nutritional values has led me to lose 95 lbs. i feel great, too! used for years!! great for calorie counting and keeping track of my nutrition values. Great app easy to use and excellent for daily use. so far the app has helped me lose 18 ibsbrilliant  it is easy to log your foods. has info on many foods and restaurants. great tool. helps me keep track of meals well. excellent as always the best app to use good app. easy to use  used this for years. fantastic my trainer arman at 24 our fitness set this app up for me so that i could track my progress. i also like the articles on recipes and nutritional information, and sometimes i try to make the dishes. the ability to find specific foods from stores and restaurants makes it easy to do your daily check in. another great feature is the bar code reader, meaning less typing. Great app, keeps me honest! really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. beautiful product with many options to assess your meals. i started using the app after a heart attack. i use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. it's great. The app helps me track my macros, so i can keep my protein and fat high and carbs low. functionality is great and relatively user friendly. the database often has any food i need. i've kept the extra weight off for 5 years now.  myfitnesspal is amazing! it has been a huge help in my weight loss journey. the food database is huge, and the barcode scanner makes logging meals super easy. it tracks my progress and syncs with my other fitness apps. highly recommend for anyone looking to get healthier!"

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"
fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever ,fitbit charge defective screen tried fix fried reboot tried clock face change fact tried everything fed fit bin expensive waste money ever,NEGATIVE,,fitbit charge defective screen tried fix fried reboot tried clock face change fact tried everything fed fit bin expensive waste money ever,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact!

Tried to return the fitbit as under warranty involves printing off a trees worth of paper in consignment notes etc. You have to go on hold to the courier company selected by google within australia. Nearly an hour later someone picks up and agrees you can’t do this online and they book you a pick up slot. However that window at your home address is between 9am and 5pm and you have to be home as they won't just pick it up. i see myself and many others have their fitbit account hacked. some of the responses on their helpcenter goes to say that the customer read the email wrong which is kind of funny. i recommend a garmin watch, their software is also very good and can link up to other third party apps. Customer service is a joke. never ending runaround just to get a replacement for a defective versa 3. shambles of a device. didn't last 18 months and they expect me to buy a new one at 35% discount. absolute joke. don't buy these products, they aren't made to last. Had a charge 4 and it performed pretty well apart from it not linking up with my phone after a period and then the bit that attached to the strap snapped and it was no longer usable. Was still in warranty but to try and contact fitbit to replace the product is a joke. i won't be buying a fitbit again. i can no longer scan a barcode on, say, a loaf of bread without signing up for their premium service. what a joke! i won't be using this app again. so long, mFP!"
charge 5 black screen. the supposed service departments gives all kind of directions but nothing works. in the end they tell you we cannot further help you. no fitbit for me anymore,charge black screen supposed service department give kind direction nothing work end tell help fitbit anymore,NEGATIVE,,charge black screen supposed service department give kind direction nothing work end tell help fitbit anymore,neutral,
"terrible watch, tracking doesn’t sync and when it does the steps, calories and activities all drop to nothing like you’ve not done anything! customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. don’t waste your money with these watches. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! ",terrible watch tracking sync step calorie activity drop nothing like done anything customer service shocking fitbit month every week issue waste money watch called fitbit emailed several time response back get someone solution,NEGATIVE,,terrible watch tracking sync step calorie activity drop nothing like done anything customer service shocking fitbit month every week issue waste money watch called fitbit emailed several time response back get someone solution,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

first versa 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. impossible to get my complaint escalated in their cs process. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!,first versa faulty eventually replaced replacement lasted month neither lasted year year warranty fitbit offered rrp actual current selling price basically new watch impossible get complaint escalated c process company really could care le shoddy buy,NEGATIVE,,first versa faulty eventually replaced replacement lasted month neither lasted year year warranty fitbit offered rrp actual current selling price basically new watch impossible get complaint escalated c process company really could care le shoddy buy,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever.

Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"
"i contacted fitbit in the morning as i was looking to explore some watch strap recommendations for my versa 3 i got secondhand a couple of weeks ago. my current rubber one that came with the watch wasn’t helping my eczema and unfortunately worsening it, so i wanted to switch to something breathable and more friendly for sensitive skin. i went onto the website forums and ended up contacting the customer help chat and spoke to two lovely people named valentina and julian. both were helpful and polite. i told them about my issue and wondered if they could recommend a better strap for me to get or see if there was anything more i could do with my current strap to stop irritating my skin. they amazingly ended up offering me a free woven band to replace my current one in the hopes that it will be kinder to my skin. this was so fast, so kind and really made a stressful week better. thank you so much!

The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

"such a bad quality, designed to fail the day after the guarantee expires.i liked fitbit fitness trackers at the beginning; the entire family used them. we are not fitness freaks to use them intensively and we are not swimming or showering with the devices. they have an easy life with us and we maintain them well. it is not the usage that caused the below failures. here is the story of the devices we owned:fitbit charge 3 - after warranty expired the screen lost its brightness, impossible to use, simply too dark and no way to configure/change that. fitbit versa 3 - the contacts on the back of the watch  wore out so the contact with the charger cannot be made and the watch would not charge. just shortly after it went out of warranty. normal usage, just plugging the charger when it needed a charge and in two years the metal from the contacts was gone. fitbit charge 5 #1 - after 10 months the sensors on the back started to go crazy, burned my hand. the battery at 100% would last for minutes only and the whole thing would be burning hot. device replaced promptly by google. nine months later the replacement device breaks, a piece comes apart (bad glue i guess) and the device keeps crashing and not recording anything. google is currently replacing it - this is the only device left in use but warranty expires in 2 months.... fitbit charge 5 #2 - after 1.5 years the screen goes pink, device crashes often and becomes unusable. google promptly replaces it. after 10 months the replacement device stops recording the pulse, steps, etc. battery gets from 100% to 0% in 4-5 hours. support is asking me to disable everything (notifications, spo2, everything that could consume battery). device still broken; just 1 month out of warranty so no replacement this time. generously google support is offering me a 35% discount on their shop for a new device. on their shop where the price of a charge 5 is 35% more than on amazon, lol. to be correct, the netto difference between google shop with 35% discount and amazon would be precisely 6.5eur in my favour. but no thank you, i pass this time.we also owned a charge 4 but i do not remember when we had to throw it to the bin and why. the support is prompt and professional, but they are limited by their script. thanks to those people that do their job.conclusions:- low quality, incredible failure rate. - never again buying a fitbit, i've had enough",bad quality designed fail day guarantee liked fitbit fitness tracker beginning entire family used fitness freak use intensively swimming showering device easy life u maintain well usage caused failure story device owned fitbit charge warranty expired screen lost brightness impossible use simply dark way fitbit versa contact back watch wore contact charger made watch would charge shortly went warranty normal usage plugging charger needed charge two year metal contact gone fitbit charge month sensor back started go crazy burned hand battery would last minute whole thing would burning hot device replaced promptly google nine month later replacement device break piece come apart bad glue guess device keep crashing recording anything google currently replacing device left use warranty expires month fitbit charge year screen go pink device crash often becomes unusable google promptly replaces month replacement device stop recording pulse step etc battery get hour support asking disable everything notification everything could consume battery device still broken month warranty replacement time generously google support offering discount shop new device shop price charge amazon lol correct netto difference google shop discount amazon would precisely favour thank pas also owned charge remember throw bin support prompt professional limited script thanks people low quality incredible failure rate never buying fitbit enough,NEGATIVE,,bad quality designed fail day guarantee liked fitbit fitness tracker beginning entire family used fitness freak use intensively swimming showering device easy life u maintain well usage caused failure story device owned fitbit charge warranty expired screen lost brightness impossible use simply dark way fitbit versa contact back watch wore contact charger made watch would charge shortly went warranty normal usage plugging charger needed charge two year metal contact gone fitbit charge month sensor back started go crazy burned hand battery would last minute whole thing would burning hot device replaced promptly google nine month later replacement device break piece come apart bad glue guess device keep crashing recording anything google currently replacing device left use warranty expires month fitbit charge year screen go pink device crash often becomes unusable google promptly replaces month replacement device stop recording pulse step etc battery get hour support asking disable everything notification everything could consume battery device still broken month warranty replacement time generously google support offering discount shop new device shop price charge amazon lol correct netto difference google shop discount amazon would precisely favour thank pas also owned charge remember throw bin support prompt professional limited script thanks people low quality incredible failure rate never buying fitbit enough,neutral,

Please submit your best shots of New York for next week. Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of snapshots. i love fitbit and am obsessed with my watch. over the past 4 years my fitbit has stopped working twice and both times they ask me to send it back and have sent me a brand new one! not many companies would do that so i think it's great. i generally find it so great for tracking all my exercise too and there’s so much you can do on the app. i would never move to any other watch and always recommend them. my fitbit stopped working, customer service was useless and just offered me discount on a new purchase. when i asked how to make a complaint they went from replying promptly to completely ignoring me. i only wish i'd read the reviews years ago as i certainly would've avoided this company. i know they had a premium service that could go in depth but now all basic functions are behind that paywall. my advice: use a different app. used to be a great app, now they have changed it so you need to pay for the most basic of functions. The app runs well most of the time but sometimes doesn't work as well. other than the negative, a good app. they need to sort the money business out. sort it out strava! good at dealing with specific enquiries on rides, but there are some long highlighted general issues that have been raised many times by different people. happy with the overall use of the site via a pc, not so much so on the app. going the paid route opens up so much more and this is both insightful and in my case, helps motivate me. i find the menu easy to navigate, and the info on calories and nutrients is very helpful. search function in “add a food” has some incorrect calorie counts. system automatically adds my exercise calories to my daily total. i can’t opt out of that without upgrading to premium. i have been using myfitnesspal for many years and i had bariatric surgery 3 years ago and this is a very handy tool to use to track. what i used to like i was able to scan my food for free. however now i write my food in because for scanning it isn't free anymore. i still like tracking calories even though i write them in.  myfitnesspal has become my de facto way of keeping track of calories. its accurate, extremely easy to use and would be difficult to do without. this app has a very extensive data base so makes it easy to track my daily food intake. My fitness pal is a brilliant app for managing everything linked to a healthy lifestyle. it is easy to use and if you subscribe to the premium service then you get fantastic value for money. i personally use the basic service for free as my only requirement is the food diary. you will not be disappointed using my fitness pal, and i will guarantee that. i've been using this app to track workouts and meals for years. i trust its data more than any other app i've used. it’s app is easy to use and they everything imaginable listed! i still use the free app and am tempted to try the updated version. Myfitnesspal is right on. always room for improvement, especially for people who don't eat processed food. having to continually put in ingredients i choose to eat is somewhat challenging, especially since i often substitute the alternative ingredients in recipes. i use mFP to track my weight and calories, and it has helped me achieve my fitness goals through the years. fitness pal is easy to use, to check my daily nutrients (calories, carbs, fiber, etc). most of my meal choices are already included in the data. The app is easy to use and perfect for managing my fitness goals. easy ti use and upload myfeedback which was welcomed by the company i bought from. i've been using it consistently for past 2 months and i'm literally seeing the results on weekly basis. i have been using this app daily for over a year. the workout feature is hit and miss, but basically it works well. it’s easy to communicate with other bikers in the community and share experiences. This app is simple to use and really helps me stay on track. wo helpful and easy. it does what i need it to do when i use it right. it has what i want. i’m a long time user and credit my fitness pal with providing both information and the discipline needed to first lose weight and then maintain. i have many friends who complain about not being able to lose weight but have no clue about how many calories, carbs, fats etc they consume. additionally they don’t understand how few calories are actually needed by the human body per day or the amount of exercise needed per day. i was recently diagnosed with gallbladder and liver issues. myfitnesspal has made it much easier to visualize if i’m achieving my macro and nutrient goals for those conditions. with their premium features, it has been worth it! i like that i can scan food to get the nutrition info. i started the south beach diet at my dr’s recommendation and found it hard to find information within the app to follow it. good to count calories and keep trsvk. expensive to go premium."

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
"having used fitbits of various types for about 10 years i am now walking away. 4 x charge 3s replaced, thanks to paying for the enhanced protection from currys. upgraded to versa 3. now have a versa 3 graveyard on my desk thanks to all 3 of them losing their cover. it literally just fell off and the screen is hanging there. 1st one was replaced by them as in the 1 year warranty (which says a lot about their own faith in their products) 2nd one was outside the warranty period and so they gave me a 'goodwill' 30% off voucher, 3rd one shuffled off 2 weeks out of warranty and have had zero response to my communication with them. aside from the extra cost, the sheer hassle of communicating with them has taken up too much of my time. if garmin etc is out of your price bracket, go for the myriad of cheap ones. don't waste time or money on this failed product.ps the recent 5 star reviews saying how great the customer service is makes me wonder. they are definitely out of kilter with the experience of most on here.",used fitbits various type year walking away x charge replaced thanks paying enhanced protection curry upgraded versa versa graveyard desk thanks losing cover literally fell screen hanging one replaced year warranty say lot faith product one outside warranty period gave voucher one shuffled week warranty zero response communication aside extra cost sheer hassle communicating taken much time garmin etc price bracket go myriad cheap one waste time money failed recent star review saying great customer service make wonder definitely kilter experience,NEGATIVE,,used fitbits various type year walking away x charge replaced thanks paying enhanced protection curry upgraded versa versa graveyard desk thanks losing cover literally fell screen hanging one replaced year warranty say lot faith product one outside warranty period gave voucher one shuffled week warranty zero response communication aside extra cost sheer hassle communicating taken much time garmin etc price bracket go myriad cheap one waste time money failed recent star review saying great customer service make wonder definitely kilter experience,gratitude,

Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

Please submit your best shots of New York for next week. Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of snapshots. Two watches (charge 4 and 5) died right after one year of normal wear, not even exercising, or in the shower. all they offer was 35% off. doesn't even offer servicing like apple does. customer service is utterly useless and does not treat you as a human being. waste of money. i like it but unfortunately it never picks up the stairs even if i'm walking up 8 floors. charge 4 lasted 2 year, the plastic connection bit on the side of the fitbit that clips onto your strap snapped off. charge 2 stopped working after 2 year also. i have a fitbit versa 3. it is literally the worst health and lifestyle watch in the history of mankind. the versa 3 loses gps signal in the countryside, in built up areas, in residential areas, basically everywhere. it then uses some ridiculous algorithm to work out what you've done whilst the signal was lost. pathetic. do not buy. Tried to return the fitbit as under warranty involves printing off a trees worth of paper in consignment notes etc. You have to go on hold to the courier company selected by google within australia. Nearly an hour later someone picks up and agrees you can’t do this online and they book you a pick up slot. However that window at your home address is between 9am and 5pm and you have to be home as they won't just pick it up. i see myself and many others have their fitbit account hacked. some of the responses on their helpcenter goes to say that the customer read the email wrong which is kind of funny. i recommend a garmin watch, their software is also very good and can link up to other third party apps. Customer service is a joke. never ending runaround just to get a replacement for a defective versa 3. shambles of a device. didn't last 18 months and they expect me to buy a new one at 35% discount. absolute joke. don't buy these products, they aren't made to last. Had a charge 4 and it performed pretty well apart from it not linking up with my phone after a period and then the bit that attached to the strap snapped and it was no longer usable. Was still in warranty but to try and contact fitbit to replace the product is a joke. i won't be buying a fitbit again. i can no longer scan a barcode on, say, a loaf of bread without signing up for their premium service. what a joke! i won't be using this app again. so long, mFP!"

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future.

Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

Two watches (charge 4 and 5) died right after one year of normal wear, not even exercising, or in the shower. all they offer was 35% off. doesn't even offer servicing like apple does. customer service is utterly useless and does not treat you as a human being. waste of money. i like it but unfortunately it never picks up the stairs even if i'm walking up 8 floors. charge 4 lasted 2 year, the plastic connection bit on the side of the fitbit that clips onto your strap snapped off. charge 2 stopped working after 2 year also. i have a fitbit versa 3. it is literally the worst health and lifestyle watch in the history of mankind. the versa 3 loses gps signal in the countryside, in built up areas, in residential areas, basically everywhere. it then uses some ridiculous algorithm to work out what you've done whilst the signal was lost. pathetic. do not buy. Tried to return the fitbit as under warranty involves printing off a trees worth of paper in consignment notes etc. You have to go on hold to the courier company selected by google within australia. Nearly an hour later someone picks up and agrees you can’t do this online and they book you a pick up slot. However that window at your home address is between 9am and 5pm and you have to be home as they won't just pick it up. i see myself and many others have their fitbit account hacked. some of the responses on their helpcenter goes to say that the customer read the email wrong which is kind of funny. i recommend a garmin watch, their software is also very good and can link up to other third party apps. Customer service is a joke. never ending runaround just to get a replacement for a defective versa 3. shambles of a device. didn't last 18 months and they expect me to buy a new one at 35% discount. absolute joke. don't buy these products, they aren't made to last. Had a charge 4 and it performed pretty well apart from it not linking up with my phone after a period and then the bit that attached to the strap snapped and it was no longer usable. Was still in warranty but to try and contact fitbit to replace the product is a joke. i won't be buying a fitbit again. i can no longer scan a barcode on, say, a loaf of bread without signing up for their premium service. what a joke! i won't be using this app again. so long, mFP!"

is it possible to give zero stars or negative stars??? have been with fitbit since 2015. can't wait to leave. the final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. now everything has to be done on the mobile app. this is a disaster...as many people are irate. some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. plus the mobile app has many fewer features than the desktop app. this is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them!,possible give zero star negative star fitbit since ca wait leave final straw discontinuing access web application everything done mobile app disaster many people irate people like extensive work phone plus mobile app many fewer feature desktop app blatant money grab google shame,NEGATIVE,,possible give zero star negative star fitbit since ca wait leave final straw discontinuing access web application everything done mobile app disaster many people irate people like extensive work phone plus mobile app many fewer feature desktop app blatant money grab google shame,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
"awful, dishonest company. i bought the fitbit ionic a few years ago and due to safety concerns (causing severe burns to users) it has been recalled. they have disabled the watch so i can no longer use it but months later i still don’t have a refund. i have phoned and emailed multiple times without success and have started legal action against them in the small claims court as i realise they have no intention of paying me. there have been countless newspaper reports from people all over the world in the same situation and even facebook support groups. this is not an oversight, this is a deliberate strategy by fitbit not to pay. i’m surprised that a company as big as fitbit are treating their customers with such distain.

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava.

"fitbit think very carefully before buying a watch from them. mine malfunctioned within a year and their process to get an exchange is ludicrously incompetent. first of all so far it's taken 5 contacts with customer services who every time you contact need the same countless information even though you have a case already open. then they fob you off on another team so more waiting, whose sole purpose is to send you a return label. each time they also get the information wrong so they have to cancel the rma and issue another, they also each time need a photo of receipt address details and serial number, which they get wrong yet again so you then have to play the same game again by going back via customer services as one department doesn't seem to talk to the other. i've still not had a correct address label and we are over a month in. now i hear today that they will not send a new replacement either only some refurbished piece of rubbish that has been previously owned and only literally the watch, so please do not send the charger or strap back otherwise you will be in trouble. there is absolutely no way to make an official complaint via a complaint department and the chances of them actually paying attention other than the script they have in front of them is pretty much absolutely zero. i will never buy another fitbit watch after this episode and i urge other people to think twice before they do too. it's been a traumatic time and i'm still left with a duff watch",fitbit think carefully buying watch mine malfunctioned within year process get exchange ludicrously incompetent first far taken contact customer service every time contact need countless information even though case already open fob another team waiting whose sole purpose send return label time also get information wrong cancel rma issue another also time need photo receipt address detail serial number get wrong yet play game going back via customer service one department seem talk still correct address label month hear today send new replacement either refurbished piece rubbish previously owned literally watch please send charger strap back otherwise trouble absolutely way make official complaint via complaint department chance actually paying attention script front pretty much absolutely zero never buy another fitbit watch episode urge people think twice traumatic time still left duff watch,NEGATIVE,,fitbit think carefully buying watch mine malfunctioned within year process get exchange ludicrously incompetent first far taken contact customer service every time contact need countless information even though case already open fob another team waiting whose sole purpose send return label time also get information wrong cancel rma issue another also time need photo receipt address detail serial number get wrong yet play game going back via customer service one department seem talk still correct address label month hear today send new replacement either refurbished piece rubbish previously owned literally watch please send charger strap back otherwise trouble absolutely way make official complaint via complaint department chance actually paying attention script front pretty much absolutely zero never buy another fitbit watch episode urge people think twice traumatic time still left duff watch,neutral,

Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better!

Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry.

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily.

"i bought a charge 5 after my inspire hr of four years died. my fitbit charge 5 was great for about 6 months. one day it died and would not charge. customer service was quick to respond and sent a replacement on warranty which arrived quickly. i was happy. about 9 months later the same thing happened where it died and would not charge. i reached out to customer service and they told me that because it was past the warranty phase of 13 months they could not send me a replacement. keep in mind, the watch that stopped working was the one they sent me 9 months prior to replace the other one that did not work. when the watches worked they were great. i loved the features they came with, they were very durable and comfortable to wear, but neither lasted more than a year. i’m very disappointed that when they sent me an apparently faulty product that lasted less than a years they wouldn’t do anything about it because i had bought the original 15 months ago. the dying and never charging seems to be a common issue with the charge 5. other reviewers say they did not last long either. maybe some of their other trackers would be better, but after being given a second crappy watch on warranty i won’t be buying another fitbit. saving my money up for a garmin, which seem to last a lot longer, and in the meantime i’m going back to my old analogue watch.

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it.

""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out yo under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them ,broken within told replacement would sent yo warranty replacement sent customer service help ever ca seem get answer,NEGATIVE,,broken within told replacement would sent yo warranty replacement sent customer service help ever ca seem get answer,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

"honestly i feel fitbit, or should i say google is trying to drive their customers away. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more, the last one was the worst, fitbit is now garbage. i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. it was bad enough that it seems you need to replace your fitbit shortly after every year, they always fail shortly after warranty. ",honestly feel fitbit say google trying drive customer away free trial premium switching provider since google taken seems every update ruin app even last one worst fitbit garbage recommend fitbit anyone look something better difficult bad enough seems need replace fitbit shortly every year always fail shortly warranty,NEGATIVE,,honestly feel fitbit say google trying drive customer away free trial premium switching provider since google taken seems every update ruin app even last one worst fitbit garbage recommend fitbit anyone look something better difficult bad enough seems need replace fitbit shortly every year always fail shortly warranty,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. that's one of many issues.  another that's annoying is the watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. not recommended at all. ,fitbit allow amex uk contactless pay even latest google wallet replacement fitbit pay one many issue another annoying watch update roaming country time fitbit app phone started useless watch really recommended,NEGATIVE,,fitbit allow amex uk contactless pay even latest google wallet replacement fitbit pay one many issue another annoying watch update roaming country time fitbit app phone started useless watch really recommended,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

Customer service is a joke. never ending runaround just to get a replacement for a defective versa 3. shambles of a device. didn't last 18 months and they expect me to buy a new one at 35% discount. absolute joke. don't buy these products, they aren't made to last. Had a charge 4 and it performed pretty well apart from it not linking up with my phone after a period and then the bit that attached to the strap snapped and it was no longer usable. Was still in warranty but to try and contact fitbit to replace the product is a joke. i won't be buying a fitbit again. i can no longer scan a barcode on, say, a loaf of bread without signing up for their premium service. what a joke! i won't be using this app again. so long, mFP!"

Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

Please submit your best shots of New York for next week. Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of snapshots. i love fitbit and am obsessed with my watch. over the past 4 years my fitbit has stopped working twice and both times they ask me to send it back and have sent me a brand new one! not many companies would do that so i think it's great. i generally find it so great for tracking all my exercise too and there’s so much you can do on the app. i would never move to any other watch and always recommend them. my fitbit stopped working, customer service was useless and just offered me discount on a new purchase. when i asked how to make a complaint they went from replying promptly to completely ignoring me. i only wish i'd read the reviews years ago as i certainly would've avoided this company. i know they had a premium service that could go in depth but now all basic functions are behind that paywall. my advice: use a different app. used to be a great app, now they have changed it so you need to pay for the most basic of functions. The app runs well most of the time but sometimes doesn't work as well. other than the negative, a good app. they need to sort the money business out. sort it out strava! good at dealing with specific enquiries on rides, but there are some long highlighted general issues that have been raised many times by different people. happy with the overall use of the site via a pc, not so much so on the app. going the paid route opens up so much more and this is both insightful and in my case, helps motivate me. i find the menu easy to navigate, and the info on calories and nutrients is very helpful. search function in “add a food” has some incorrect calorie counts. system automatically adds my exercise calories to my daily total. i can’t opt out of that without upgrading to premium. i have been using myfitnesspal for many years and i had bariatric surgery 3 years ago and this is a very handy tool to use to track. what i used to like i was able to scan my food for free. however now i write my food in because for scanning it isn't free anymore. i still like tracking calories even though i write them in.  myfitnesspal has become my de facto way of keeping track of calories. its accurate, extremely easy to use and would be difficult to do without. this app has a very extensive data base so makes it easy to track my daily food intake. My fitness pal is a brilliant app for managing everything linked to a healthy lifestyle. it is easy to use and if you subscribe to the premium service then you get fantastic value for money. i personally use the basic service for free as my only requirement is the food diary. you will not be disappointed using my fitness pal, and i will guarantee that. i've been using this app to track workouts and meals for years. i trust its data more than any other app i've used. it’s app is easy to use and they everything imaginable listed! i still use the free app and am tempted to try the updated version. Myfitnesspal is right on. always room for improvement, especially for people who don't eat processed food. having to continually put in ingredients i choose to eat is somewhat challenging, especially since i often substitute the alternative ingredients in recipes. i use mFP to track my weight and calories, and it has helped me achieve my fitness goals through the years. fitness pal is easy to use, to check my daily nutrients (calories, carbs, fiber, etc). most of my meal choices are already included in the data. The app is easy to use and perfect for managing my fitness goals. easy ti use and upload myfeedback which was welcomed by the company i bought from. i've been using it consistently for past 2 months and i'm literally seeing the results on weekly basis. i have been using this app daily for over a year. the workout feature is hit and miss, but basically it works well. it’s easy to communicate with other bikers in the community and share experiences. This app is simple to use and really helps me stay on track. wo helpful and easy. it does what i need it to do when i use it right. it has what i want. i’m a long time user and credit my fitness pal with providing both information and the discipline needed to first lose weight and then maintain. i have many friends who complain about not being able to lose weight but have no clue about how many calories, carbs, fats etc they consume. additionally they don’t understand how few calories are actually needed by the human body per day or the amount of exercise needed per day. i was recently diagnosed with gallbladder and liver issues. myfitnesspal has made it much easier to visualize if i’m achieving my macro and nutrient goals for those conditions. with their premium features, it has been worth it! i like that i can scan food to get the nutrition info. i started the south beach diet at my dr’s recommendation and found it hard to find information within the app to follow it. good to count calories and keep trsvk. expensive to go premium."

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account.

The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
my aria 2 has not worked correctly since the app update last year. customer service is horrible. they repeatedly send the same troubleshooting steps that also do not work. they do not care to fix the issue. dio not buy. i would not recommend to anyone. i have live chatted and called at least 6 times with no resolution.,aria worked correctly since app update last year customer service horrible repeatedly send troubleshooting step also work care fix issue dio buy would recommend anyone live chatted called least time resolution,NEGATIVE,,aria worked correctly since app update last year customer service horrible repeatedly send troubleshooting step also work care fix issue dio buy would recommend anyone live chatted called least time resolution,disapproval,
"i've been a customer for many years and have always loved fitbit. until recently. my charge 5 broke after just over a year. i got a discount code for the charge 6 and ordered one. this was may 20th and it was supposed to ship in ""late may"". then it changed to ""early june."" now ""late june"". i have reached out to customer support twice and they are no help. i have a feeling it'll just be an infinite backorder! it seems this is happening to other folks on the fitbit forums, especially if they used a discount code. it seems that fitbit is creating poor quality products and then not honoring the discounts they give customers when those products break. buyer beware!

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better!

This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

"i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a defective device from my friend was replaced once, only to be rendered useless by fitbit's updates. despite acknowledging the issue, they refused to provide a functional device or a full refund, offering a meager 50% discount on a future purchase. this experience reeks of prioritizing profits over customer satisfaction, leaving me feeling scammed. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence.",appalled fitbit subpar service defective device friend replaced rendered useless fitbit update despite acknowledging issue refused provide functional device full refund offering meager discount future purchase experience reek prioritizing profit customer satisfaction leaving feeling scammed taking business elsewhere avoiding monthly payment inadequate service lawsuit may necessary hold fitbit accountable negligence,NEGATIVE,,appalled fitbit subpar service defective device friend replaced rendered useless fitbit update despite acknowledging issue refused provide functional device full refund offering meager discount future purchase experience reek prioritizing profit customer satisfaction leaving feeling scammed taking business elsewhere avoiding monthly payment inadequate service lawsuit may necessary hold fitbit accountable negligence,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"
yet another fitbit failed!  customer support is difficult to get hold of (i dont have or wnt a twitter / x account) so i have just given up after 11 years with a fitbit on my wrist..,yet another fitbit failed customer support difficult get hold dont wnt twitter x account given year fitbit wrist,NEGATIVE,,yet another fitbit failed customer support difficult get hold dont wnt twitter x account given year fitbit wrist,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
"fitbit has to have the worst customer service i've ever had to deal with. long wait times ranging from 10 minutes to over 2 hours just to speak with someone on chat. and even in cases where they've they promised that you'd be able to chat with a representative in 3 minutes frequently turns into 12 minutes which is more than the 3x times as much or when they promise 10 minutes, but it turns into 30 minutes. unlike every other company out there fitbit gives you no option to have someone from there contact you back you're expected to give up or just stay on hold.the under day my friend was having problems with his internet when he contacted his cell phone company at&t they told him the wait time would be up to 2 hours or more so they asked him if he would like to have someone from at&t contact him back, he was able to have someone call him back withing 30 minutes and they were able to resolve his issue. they didn't expect him to just stay on hold. in another issue i was having problems with amazon when i contacted them, they said the wait times would be long, but i could leave my number, and someone would call me back and someone did and was able to resolve my issue again they didn't expect me to just keep holding like fitbit does",fitbit worst customer service ever deal long wait time ranging minute hour speak someone chat even case promised able chat representative minute frequently turn minute time much promise minute turn minute unlike every company fitbit give option someone contact back expected give stay day friend problem internet contacted cell phone company told wait time would hour asked would like someone contact back able someone call back withing minute able resolve issue expect stay hold another issue problem amazon contacted said wait time would long could leave number someone would call back someone able resolve issue expect keep holding like fitbit,NEGATIVE,,fitbit worst customer service ever deal long wait time ranging minute hour speak someone chat even case promised able chat representative minute frequently turn minute time much promise minute turn minute unlike every company fitbit give option someone contact back expected give stay day friend problem internet contacted cell phone company told wait time would hour asked would like someone contact back able someone call back withing minute able resolve issue expect stay hold another issue problem amazon contacted said wait time would long could leave number someone would call back someone able resolve issue expect keep holding like fitbit,neutral,

An expensive bit of kit, which has been reliable for the two years i have owned it. my really big concern is having spent a lot of money on its initial purchase to really benefit you have to then pay to use all the functions within the app. knowing what i know now in no way, shape or form would buy another fitbit. realistically at its purchase the complete and full app should come with it all included. i don’t get fooled twice and i hope none of you out there get fooled once. i’m writing this regarding a versa 4 my wife bought for me as a christmas gift in december 2022. this watch recently died and could not be reset, less than 6 months after warranty ended. fitbit support offered a 35% discount on a new one instead of replacing it.  don't buy this product or do so at your own risk.  fitbit charge5 stopped syncing with the mobile app 12apr 2024. i bought it in april 2023. i tried all the steps available online and on the fitbit community forum. nothing worked. 16 apr 2024 - i had a live chat with fitbit onine.

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava.

"used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste.",used fitbit month completely dead charge screen nothing even know contact customer service total waste,NEGATIVE,,used fitbit month completely dead charge screen nothing even know contact customer service total waste,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"
up until recently i would have given fitbit full marks but the recent changes in how data is shown on the app has reduced this to one star. the final straw is how the sleep data is shown. there are many users unhappy about this as shown on the  community board but no comments from fitbit who prefer to ignore their users. well i will not be a user for long unless they change it back. ,recently would given fitbit full mark recent change data shown app reduced one star final straw sleep data shown many user unhappy shown community board comment fitbit prefer ignore user well user long unless change back,NEGATIVE,,recently would given fitbit full mark recent change data shown app reduced one star final straw sleep data shown many user unhappy shown community board comment fitbit prefer ignore user well user long unless change back,neutral,

fitbit is definitely dying a death.  since they got rid of the challenges and customer services became very unhelpful i've lost all faith in them.  there's so much more out there these days,fitbit definitely dying death since got rid challenge customer service became unhelpful lost faith much day,NEGATIVE,,fitbit definitely dying death since got rid challenge customer service became unhelpful lost faith much day,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
"i have been a long time user of fitbit.  i have had several products.  a couple of months ago my charge 5 quit syncing with the app.  after numerous attempts with support, they decided to offer me a charge 6 at a reduced rate.  that device would not sync, so they replaced it and the next device would also not pair with the app despite several hours with support trying to pair the various devices.  i returned the charge 6 for a refund, but the refund department did not process the refund, so i had to call again and spend 20 minutes on the phone to tell me it will be another 3-5 days for my refund to post.  i am fed up with fitbit and will never buy another device.  their customer support is terrible.",long time user fitbit several product couple month ago charge quit syncing app numerous attempt support decided offer charge reduced rate device would sync replaced next device would also pair app despite several hour support trying pair various device returned charge refund refund department process refund call spend minute phone tell another day refund post fed fitbit never buy another device customer support terrible,NEGATIVE,,long time user fitbit several product couple month ago charge quit syncing app numerous attempt support decided offer charge reduced rate device would sync replaced next device would also pair app despite several hour support trying pair various device returned charge refund refund department process refund call spend minute phone tell another day refund post fed fitbit never buy another device customer support terrible,neutral,
fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one ,fitbit charge failed within year replaced february one stopped working totally dead would never buy another one,NEGATIVE,,fitbit charge failed within year replaced february one stopped working totally dead would never buy another one,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
"versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. when reported, the service was appalling/ useless. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business.",versa would charge month reported service useless ashamed got useless unhelpful message surely go business,NEGATIVE,,versa would charge month reported service useless ashamed got useless unhelpful message surely go business,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"
"fitbit app used to be excellent. it is in decline unless you pay their monthly subscription! i paid £400 for a piece of tech and can only use its full potential if i keep paying! you can shove it fitbit, no doubt you are making fortunes using all the data you have on us too!

Sleep tracking is excellent, easy to use with a simple to learn ui. battery life is brilliant, last several days! superb fitness trackers with a very competitive prices. charge 5 worked perfectly and now i am on charge 6, which is just as good with a minor improvements, all adds up to very smooth user experience. great app for cyclists! it's my every day app for recording my sports activities. the segments feature is super addictive. no problem to pay 59 usd per year for it. keep up the good job by continuously adding features! great product and social experience with a positive effect. Each email takes 3-5 working days to get a response, and in my case the support agent took two of those emails to ask the same question twice (adding 10 days to the resolution) it took weeks to resolve a basic problem. a few months back i started tracking my walks. i do 2 miles a day minimum, and just being able to see all the data set me on my journey to lose weight and get fitter. i now use strava, and garmin app together. very good app. i can build my cycling routes easily and also share them with my fellow-cyclists. strava can connect with multiple cycling computers even those that are sold on aliexpress. which makes it easier to follow the routes i build in the strava app. i have been using strava for nearly 3 years. it's great an compatible with my apple watch. i have rated it 4 stars because the have removed feature, making them ""summit"" (premium) features. i use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great. excellent performance but the app hcrashes too much no, put a fix on it. only using the free app version so far for my runs and i really like it.  give it a go. Great website for tracking fitness activities. they could do with more premium features for runners. the site seems very geared towards cyclists. it's a great app, with information that can help people through any type of fitness journey. i appreciate the notifications throughout the day to log my meals. it's super easy to look up the foods i have either by the search bar or barcode. i'd like to see more nutrients/minerals in the nutrient breakdown tab. also less ads would be nice. App has helped me lose weight, eat better, exercise more, reach my goals and stay on track/maintain. great database for tracking food at meals, integration of data to/from other health apps and devices, nice goal setting/tracking features. Great app to track your calories and workouts! searching for food, it is a very thorough and complete database and very easy to find what you need for quick logins. The ability to make and save recipes is a great asset to the app! i've had for 3 years and it's been of invaluable help with my bulking and cutting bodybuilding cycles. brilliant bar code facility. would love if it was possible to duplicate items for multiple meals and days but other than that very user friendly. i’ve used this as a valuable tool to track my calories for the past 8 years. i like that u can put exercises in too. it helps to keep track of the days i exercise, all in one app. i'm amazed by how many foods are in the data bank. if the food i want is not there, i can usually find one similar. the posted columns are very useful and helpful. i especially like the recipes. It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what i'm eating. shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of premium for a pensioner is a little steep. Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight excellent app. taught me well about macro nutrition facts. it’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the upc - only accessible via the paid app. that was a greedy move. This app has helped me on my way of losing 38 pounds in about 3 months! tracking my food and nutritional values has led me to lose 95 lbs. i feel great, too! used for years!! great for calorie counting and keeping track of my nutrition values. Great app easy to use and excellent for daily use. so far the app has helped me lose 18 ibsbrilliant  it is easy to log your foods. has info on many foods and restaurants. great tool. helps me keep track of meals well. excellent as always the best app to use good app. easy to use  used this for years. fantastic my trainer arman at 24 our fitness set this app up for me so that i could track my progress. i also like the articles on recipes and nutritional information, and sometimes i try to make the dishes. the ability to find specific foods from stores and restaurants makes it easy to do your daily check in. another great feature is the bar code reader, meaning less typing. Great app, keeps me honest! really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. beautiful product with many options to assess your meals. i started using the app after a heart attack. i use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. it's great. The app helps me track my macros, so i can keep my protein and fat high and carbs low. functionality is great and relatively user friendly. the database often has any food i need. i've kept the extra weight off for 5 years now.  myfitnesspal is amazing! it has been a huge help in my weight loss journey. the food database is huge, and the barcode scanner makes logging meals super easy. it tracks my progress and syncs with my other fitness apps. highly recommend for anyone looking to get healthier!"

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
"i am disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the fitbit charge 4. the charging cable failed on the fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. the second charging cable also failed so i had to buy a third one. a few days ago, the top cover screen of my fitbit sense popped open, the functions stopped working, and there was no way to repair it. several times, i tried to clip it back into place but failed each time.  please see the photographs below for reference purposes. this fitbit sense was used very lightly and carefully, just for walking, not even for running, swimming, gym or sports.  i didn't expect to have so many problems with it.  there is online advice about how to solder the ""third pin"" on the charging cable and how to glue the screen back on, but the fundamental point is that these types of problems should not have occurred in the first place.  also, gluing the screen does not necessarily resolve the complete loss of functionality.i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products.",disappointed poor quality fitbit product bought fitbit charge fitbit sense tracker watch two separate occasion band broke fitbit charge one band replaced warranty charging cable failed fitbit charge charging cable failed fitbit sense specific reference charging cable vulnerable third pin fails easily even careful use second charging cable also failed buy third one day ago top cover screen fitbit sense popped open function stopped working way repair several time tried clip back place failed time please see photograph reference purpose fitbit sense used lightly carefully walking even running swimming gym sport expect many problem online advice solder third pin charging cable glue screen back fundamental point type problem occurred first place also gluing screen necessarily resolve complete loss extremely disappointed poor quality fitbit product,NEGATIVE,,disappointed poor quality fitbit product bought fitbit charge fitbit sense tracker watch two separate occasion band broke fitbit charge one band replaced warranty charging cable failed fitbit charge charging cable failed fitbit sense specific reference charging cable vulnerable third pin fails easily even careful use second charging cable also failed buy third one day ago top cover screen fitbit sense popped open function stopped working way repair several time tried clip back place failed time please see photograph reference purpose fitbit sense used lightly carefully walking even running swimming gym sport expect many problem online advice solder third pin charging cable glue screen back fundamental point type problem occurred first place also gluing screen necessarily resolve complete loss extremely disappointed poor quality fitbit product,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin.

"awful. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! ",awful stopped using month fitbit came free premium access took premium renewal without notification cant contact,NEGATIVE,,awful stopped using month fitbit came free premium access took premium renewal without notification cant contact,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"
both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart.  can’t afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good,fitbits broke le year restart afford replace watch often disappointed work good,NEGATIVE,,fitbits broke le year restart afford replace watch often disappointed work good,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
i don’t know what happened to fitbit.  now you have to order through the google store- beware you can’t return orders.  the online return feature doesn’t work and if you call they just blow you off.  i am out over $100 and no o w will get back to me!!!!,know happened fitbit order google beware return order online return feature work call blow w get back,NEGATIVE,,know happened fitbit order google beware return order online return feature work call blow w get back,confusion,"CNN.com will feature iReporter photos in a weekly Travel Snapshots gallery.

Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of snapshots. i’ve tried contacting fitbit twice over the last month and nobody has bothered to acknowledge either of my emails. the warranty is absolutely useless if nobody is there to fix an issue when it presents. i don’t know how such an established business is allowed to operate like this with no accountability. i will definitely go to a competitor who can be trusted to honour a warranty. i've been a fitbit customer for years and have always been really happy but since this merger with google their customer service has really gone downhill. my fitbit has just broken but is within warranty. last time this happened i just got on to customer services and they sorted me a new one before the end of the day. this morning i've spent 2 hours on customer services unable to verify my account because it's not with registered with google. the person kept telling me it was my fault and there was nothing they could do. not sure what to do now and fitbit don't seem interested in trying to help or retain me as a customer. i don't know what happened to fitbit.  now you have to order through the google store- beware you can’t return orders. i am out over $100 and no o w will get back to me!!!! it was free before, but now all main core features are under subscription. i have a free account in the uk, which i’ve never paid for. i used it twice in san francisco for two bike rides and strava have charges me two lots of £47.99 on the same day!! the app never asked for permission or credit card details. they just helped themselves to my money. i really don't know how!i will be cancelling my account and reporting the fraudulent transaction to my credit card provider. avoid!! i inadvertently bought a 14 month subscription thinking it was a free trial (the get two months free causing the confusion) however the response to my email (cancelling my paid for subscription and sorting out a refund) was done quickly and without any fuss. only feedback to strava, maybe think about how promotions are worded to avoid confusion in the future."
"i bought my 1st fitbit 3 in nov 2019 following surgery to help keep tabs of exercise taken. i then bought one for the wife for xmas. my f3 broke 12 months later so i took my wifes who wasnt that bothered. that one also broke so f4 came and went then fitbit 5 late 2022. fitbit 5 failed sep 2023, so a new one arrived under warranty from germany after weeks of delays and messing me around big time. charge 5 failed june 2024 just 8 months later... during nearly 5 years of fault finding, rebooting etc...i realised they are unreliable. anyway this week...having established that google are now in charge...i thought...lets give them another chance...so coughed up £119 for a charge 6 via amazon...so having years of experience of setting these up.. opened up the f app....then it requested my google account...which i entered...only to be told it wasnt suitable! what is going on? so i calls up fitbit c/s who confirmed that charge 6 requires a particular type of google account. then we had a conversation about whether i was entitled to a refund for the failed charge 5...that was negative.so my advice after trying to make fitbit devices work for 5 years...is simply do not buy them!",bought fitbit nov following surgery help keep tab exercise taken bought one wife xmas broke month later took wife wasnt bothered one also broke came went fitbit late fitbit failed sep new one arrived warranty germany week delay messing around big time charge failed june month later nearly year fault finding rebooting etc realised unreliable anyway week established google charge thought let give another chance coughed charge via amazon year experience setting opened f app requested google account entered told wasnt suitable going call fitbit confirmed charge requires particular type google account conversation whether entitled refund failed charge advice trying make fitbit device work year simply buy,NEGATIVE,,bought fitbit nov following surgery help keep tab exercise taken bought one wife xmas broke month later took wife wasnt bothered one also broke came went fitbit late fitbit failed sep new one arrived warranty germany week delay messing around big time charge failed june month later nearly year fault finding rebooting etc realised unreliable anyway week established google charge thought let give another chance coughed charge via amazon year experience setting opened f app requested google account entered told wasnt suitable going call fitbit confirmed charge requires particular type google account conversation whether entitled refund failed charge advice trying make fitbit device work year simply buy,neutral,
"amazon buyer beware!!!while i have completely enjoyed my experience with my fitbit charge 5 itself i am very compelled to let everyone i can reach about the downside of my fitbit experience. i purchased the charge 5 this past july 2023 and over the memorial day weekend it died. i spent hours yesterday trying to get some help being disconnected twice while waiting far beyond the timer shown in the queue. the chat was somewhat successful while the rep walked me through the various troubleshooting methods. alas, nothing worked! the rep informed me that my “case” would be referred to the warranty department. several hours later i received an email notifying me that due to the fact that i purchased the fitbit from amazon they would not honor the warranty that would have otherwise remedied the problem. amazon i think the largest retailer in the us if not the entire world. their orders have to be huge. they are not “authorized retailer” are you joking? i has been a hard no getting any satisfaction from either fitbit or from amazon. they keep telling me to appeal to the other. bottom line i am out of a working fitbit worth $150.00 and neither will do a thing about it. how does that work. consumers be aware that if you purchase a fitbit from amazon it will not have any warranty and the manufacturer fitbit will not stand behind their product most likely due to the unit price they received from amazon",amazon buyer beware completely enjoyed experience fitbit charge compelled let everyone reach downside fitbit experience purchased charge past july memorial day weekend died spent hour yesterday trying get help disconnected twice waiting far beyond timer shown queue chat somewhat successful rep walked various troubleshooting method ala nothing worked rep informed case would referred warranty department several hour later received email notifying due fact purchased fitbit amazon would honor warranty would otherwise remedied problem amazon think largest retailer u entire world order huge authorized retailer joking hard getting satisfaction either fitbit amazon keep telling appeal bottom line working fitbit worth neither thing work consumer aware purchase fitbit amazon warranty manufacturer fitbit stand behind product likely due unit price received amazon,NEGATIVE,,amazon buyer beware completely enjoyed experience fitbit charge compelled let everyone reach downside fitbit experience purchased charge past july memorial day weekend died spent hour yesterday trying get help disconnected twice waiting far beyond timer shown queue chat somewhat successful rep walked various troubleshooting method ala nothing worked rep informed case would referred warranty department several hour later received email notifying due fact purchased fitbit amazon would honor warranty would otherwise remedied problem amazon think largest retailer u entire world order huge authorized retailer joking hard getting satisfaction either fitbit amazon keep telling appeal bottom line working fitbit worth neither thing work consumer aware purchase fitbit amazon warranty manufacturer fitbit stand behind product likely due unit price received amazon,neutral,

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides.

Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful.

The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

"i am honestly disgusted by fitbit. i’ve had three fitbits in the last three years. the first fitbit got scratched, so i reached out to fitbit. they never told me that scratches were not covered under warranty, they simply gave me a coupon code to buy another one, which i did. after that one scratched too, i reached out to fitbit yet again after one month. this is when they told me that scratches were not covered under warranty, and offered yet another coupon code to buy yet another fitbit! i said that i cannot believe that a company as large as fitbit doesn’t even provide a warranty for their products for one month! these are watches you’re supposed to wear 24-7…you can’t make a material that doesn’t scratch? they finally gave in and gave me another fitbit for free. i’ve had this one for a year, but it suddenly stopped charging. after trying all the troubleshooting techniques that they gave me, they yet again said that it is not covered under warranty, and tried to give me a third coupon code to buy a fourth fitbit. i will never buy another fitbit again!

used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless...,used fitbit year watch many issue customer service hopeless,NEGATIVE,,used fitbit year watch many issue customer service hopeless,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
the only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. they've recently changed it and it's rubbish. now if you get up in the night and go to the toilet it seems to only count the sleep you have after that. so it's repeatedly telling me i've only had 5 hours sleep which is a load of rubbish. now it's just a waste of time and space. ,reason bought see sleep quality recently changed rubbish get night go toilet seems count sleep repeatedly telling hour sleep load rubbish waste time space,NEGATIVE,,reason bought see sleep quality recently changed rubbish get night go toilet seems count sleep repeatedly telling hour sleep load rubbish waste time space,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

"i have had a fitbit luxe for less than 2 years.  first it was burning holes in my wrist from the metal charging prongs. after i built up a bunch of scar tissue there, i stopped having issues. however, for the last 6 months or so i have had problems keeping my fitbit charged.  i get it charged to 100% and less than a day later it stops functioning.  i put it on the charger and it tells me that i still have a 93% charge, but it isn't funtioning or tracking anything. then i get it up to 100% and then reset it and then it is back to 93% again.  i do this a couple of times and then put it on, but 12 hours later it stops functioning again. fitbit made this tracker with a battery that cannot be replaced.  i did not spend over $100 only to have to replace the entire tracker every year or so.  if i wanted a throw-away watch, i would have spent $10 at walmart, but even with those you can replace the batteries. i have had one for years. however, i wanted to be able to track my steps and my sleep and i have not been able to do either reliably for quite some time now and the fitbit brand was supposed to be the best of the best and it is far from it.  this would be a great little tracker if it had a replaceable battery. if they intended the luxe tracker to be a throw-away unit then they should be charging throw-away prices of around $10-$20.  i am extremely disappointed with the tracker and will never buy a fitbit again.  brand means nothing if the performance of the tracker fails.",fitbit luxe le year first burning hole wrist metal charging prong built bunch scar tissue stopped issue however last month problem keeping fitbit charged get charged le day later stop functioning put charger tell still charge funtioning tracking anything get reset back couple time put hour later stop functioning fitbit made tracker battery replaced spend replace entire tracker every year wanted watch would spent walmart even replace battery one year however wanted able track step sleep able either reliably quite time fitbit brand supposed best best far would great little tracker replaceable battery intended luxe tracker unit charging price around extremely disappointed tracker never buy fitbit brand mean nothing performance tracker fails,NEGATIVE,,fitbit luxe le year first burning hole wrist metal charging prong built bunch scar tissue stopped issue however last month problem keeping fitbit charged get charged le day later stop functioning put charger tell still charge funtioning tracking anything get reset back couple time put hour later stop functioning fitbit made tracker battery replaced spend replace entire tracker every year wanted watch would spent walmart even replace battery one year however wanted able track step sleep able either reliably quite time fitbit brand supposed best best far would great little tracker replaceable battery intended luxe tracker unit charging price around extremely disappointed tracker never buy fitbit brand mean nothing performance tracker fails,neutral,
i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. our first one died in 2 years and now the second has died in 2.5 years the first time i wore it in the water.  ,completely frustrated versa love technology product crap first one died year second died year first time wore water,NEGATIVE,,completely frustrated versa love technology product crap first one died year second died year first time wore water,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
"appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of a few days out of warranty, don’t waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market ",appalling service quality watch stopped working confirmed manufacturer fault refused repair replace matter day warranty waste money cheaper better tracker watch market,NEGATIVE,,appalling service quality watch stopped working confirmed manufacturer fault refused repair replace matter day warranty waste money cheaper better tracker watch market,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily.

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business.

"i'm a fitbit user since the beginning. 3 stars - the actual device (versa 2). should have lasted longer! though the previous devices were worse, so this was an improvement.4.5 stars - customer service for ""basic"" questions. they are very polite! (5 stars for availability!)0 stars - customer service if you have a question that requires anything ""higher up"". they seem to have very little insight! perhaps someone has their hands tied?my versa 2 stopped working after a few years. i contacted fitbit and they were helpful. after troubleshooting we found it was unfixable (hr monitor doesn't register). all fine. as it was not too far out of warranty they kindly gave me a ""1-time"" discount code for the newer versa 4 device. so far so good.but then, when using the code i noticed that when submitting the order i was charged a higher price than the shopping cart said. i immediately tried to cancel the order, but fitbit.com doesn't allow cancellations! i contacted them via chat within 1 minute and they said the only solution was to ""receive it"", then return it. ok, weird, it was a weekend, but still fine. fitbit can learn from amazon and others here..now my problem is that i cannot re-order on fitbit.com because this time the discount code removes the item from the shopping cart. possibly because it's used? when asking for help, they avoid my questions, and say this in email: ""we'd like to clarify a detail regarding the discount code applied to your purchase. we noticed you might have been under the impression the ""out-of-warranty"" discount code was used. however, to maximize your savings, we applied the exclusive mother's day discount code instead.""what!? why?? i replied that when ordering i was using the code they gave me; the cart took it fine. i aiso gave them the calculations that ""full price"", minus this so called ""mother's day discount"" is still $20 more than full price minus the warranty coupon that i used. now i'm stuck without an item (as i will return this one when it arrives), because i am unable to reorder a device with the warranty coupon. they have sent my case to the higher-up team and i received 2 replies that said the same as above.update: i now have another email reply from the higher-up team. this one still avoids my question on how this can be fixed on their end so that i can either get credited the difference, or re-order. here is what they said in their email instead: ""thanks for contacting us about your recent purchase. we've looked into your case and want to clarify a few things. the out-of-warranty discount you received did offer a discount under $130, just like you mentioned. that part is correct! however, the final price you paid reflects the mother's day promotion used at checkout. unfortunately, this promotion doesn't include free shipping. we apologize for any confusion this may have caused""that's it!? i didn't ask about that. i was just attempting to give them an easy calculation so that they could see the background to why i am sking for help. their ""non answer"" is also incorrect because my order receipt from fitbit.com says: $149.95 plus tax. that's it. i can actually buy it through amazon, walmart or macys for that exact price and some of them give me 5% additional discount because of my loyalty. hence i would use them, not fitbit.com. regardless, this is irrelevant to what i'm asking.update again:i asked if they could  reissue the promo code (or fix the current one). they repeat the exact same lines as above. update again:i send them the screenshots of what the computer says when attempting to use the coupon...their email reply came a few days later: ""we apologize for all this situation, in this case we recommend you to receive the device that you already purchased and then return it back to us in order to process a refund, so you can place another order using the discount code.""huh? update again:i asked if they were actually saying that the code would work after i return the device, and they replied: ""the code could work"".the item has now been returned and the code still doesn't work!i have now ordered an amazon device (amazfit gts 4 mini) to try it out.if no furter update here there was no solution from fitbit.in conclusion, i am not happy with the people behind fitbit. this was actually a great device, and it needs to be backed by great leaders. this is not about the $20 at all, but about principle. please, please listen to what your customers are saying. a little issue shouldn't need to end up loosing one.",fitbit user since beginning star actual device versa lasted longer

Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

"horrendous customer service. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth). customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. i was thrilled and gave the customer service agent a perfect score on the review survey that followed. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled to a discount off a new device. they refused to honour their original offer of a full replacement even though they clearly stated in writing. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. a shocking customer experience.

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
"fitbit (or google) does not care about their customers. i bought a fitbit to track my sleep and fitness, but with the recent changes a once fun and colourful interface is slowly being replaced with an ugly and unusable ui. the most egregious example is the sleep tracking function. it used to be easy to read, but is now clunky, harder to understand and requires more navigating to see data.the fitbit app was wonderful before google acquired fitbit. now they’ve decided to push through a design change that is completely unwarranted and not liked by users. if something isn’t broken, stop trying to fix it! the design was so colourful and lovely, now it’s ugly and hard to use.because of this, i cannot recommend fitbit to anyone and am looking at acquiring a new sleep and fitness tracker once my old fitbit dies. please reconsider purchasing a fitbit device, they don’t care about their customer’s concerns.",fitbit google care customer bought fitbit track sleep fitness recent change fun colourful interface slowly replaced ugly unusable ui egregious example sleep tracking function used easy read clunky harder understand requires navigating see fitbit app wonderful google acquired fitbit decided push design change completely unwarranted liked user something broken stop trying fix design colourful lovely ugly hard recommend fitbit anyone looking acquiring new sleep fitness tracker old fitbit dy please reconsider purchasing fitbit device care customer concern,NEGATIVE,,fitbit google care customer bought fitbit track sleep fitness recent change fun colourful interface slowly replaced ugly unusable ui egregious example sleep tracking function used easy read clunky harder understand requires navigating see fitbit app wonderful google acquired fitbit decided push design change completely unwarranted liked user something broken stop trying fix design colourful lovely ugly hard recommend fitbit anyone looking acquiring new sleep fitness tracker old fitbit dy please reconsider purchasing fitbit device care customer concern,disapproval,
i have been a happy user of fitbit since april 2014.  however since september 2023 it has all gone downhill due to a buyout from google and change to the app.  the products themselves are good but the app needed to use them is dire since the first update last september which changed things radically making it impossible to read and access the data.  this latest update to the app has scrambled the ‘sleep’ data with many aspects now missing.  in other to gather certain stats one has to collate the data yourself.  there even longer any benchmarks include and if up you have an afternoon snooze the hours receded to the previous night data rather than that nights data.  i could go on and but i think you get the picture.,happy user fitbit since april however since september gone downhill due buyout google change app product good app needed use dire since first update last september changed thing radically making impossible read access data latest update app scrambled sleep data many aspect missing gather certain stats one collate data even longer benchmark include afternoon snooze hour receded previous night data rather night data could go think get picture,NEGATIVE,,happy user fitbit since april however since september gone downhill due buyout google change app product good app needed use dire since first update last september changed thing radically making impossible read access data latest update app scrambled sleep data many aspect missing gather certain stats one collate data even longer benchmark include afternoon snooze hour receded previous night data rather night data could go think get picture,neutral,

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies.

Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
the new update is rubbish! hate it!,new update rubbish hate,NEGATIVE,,new update rubbish hate,anger,"i hate the latest update to the fitbit app. the data is difficult to read, night's sleep hidden away in other sleeps, oxygen variability unintelligible, went from dark mode to glaring white. horrible. i suspect they are trying to move more customers over to a premium subscription but many customers will simply give up on fitbit. i've asked seven times for my account to be deleted. i get the same answer or completely ignored. people can still access my data even tho i don't want them to.indescribably angry. avoid at all costs."
"and it should be zero - pure shady ethics and dishonesty.i purchased a fitbit sense in 2022 and within 12 months (july 2023) the glass front separated from the watch. after a lot of wrangling. fitbit said they would send an upgrade. i agreed to the sense 2 but they said that it would just be the pebble and had to use the original straps and charger. i said yes and in a plastic bag arrived the pebble.i had no reason to doubt their honesty at the time. however two weeks ago i had a screen of death and when speak with customer services she said i had to disconnect and start the set-up process again. i was struggling to get it to work until she advised that it was because i had according to their records a sense and not a sense 2 watch.i found the emails from july 2023 and share these and was told that it would be escalated.yesterday, i received an email stating that as the offer for an upgrade was last year it was a limited offer and the offer was not longer applicable.seriously! so i accepted the upgrade replacement of my originally  faulty watch, and because they send out just the pebble in a plain bag without any markings etc i.e. not in an original box and there is nothing on the pebble unless you get a magnify glass where you attach the strap (i only learnt this last week) you cant identify the model. it is my fault that i did not know i didn't received what i requested.then they had the gall to offer me an option to pay for an upgrade.",zero pure shady ethic purchased fitbit sense within month july glass front separated watch lot wrangling fitbit said would send upgrade agreed sense said would pebble use original strap charger said yes plastic bag arrived reason doubt honesty time however two week ago screen death speak customer service said disconnect start process struggling get work advised according record sense sense found email july share told would received email stating offer upgrade last year limited offer offer longer accepted upgrade replacement originally faulty watch send pebble plain bag without marking etc original box nothing pebble unless get magnify glass attach strap learnt last week cant identify model fault know received gall offer option pay upgrade,NEGATIVE,,zero pure shady ethic purchased fitbit sense within month july glass front separated watch lot wrangling fitbit said would send upgrade agreed sense said would pebble use original strap charger said yes plastic bag arrived reason doubt honesty time however two week ago screen death speak customer service said disconnect start process struggling get work advised according record sense sense found email july share told would received email stating offer upgrade last year limited offer offer longer accepted upgrade replacement originally faulty watch send pebble plain bag without marking etc original box nothing pebble unless get magnify glass attach strap learnt last week cant identify model fault know received gall offer option pay upgrade,neutral,
i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. and i’m not happy with the new interfaces either. difficult to figure out. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money.,happy previous graph google changed graph sleep hard interpret happy new interface either difficult figure think google belief change since bought fitbit going apple watch save money,POSITIVE,happy previous graph google changed graph sleep hard interpret happy new interface either difficult figure think google belief change since bought fitbit going apple watch save money,,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin.

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
"sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time.",sat hour trying sync phone bluetooth error uninstall install nothing bad waste money time,NEGATIVE,,sat hour trying sync phone bluetooth error uninstall install nothing bad waste money time,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan?

Two watches (charge 4 and 5) died right after one year of normal wear, not even exercising, or in the shower. all they offer was 35% off. doesn't even offer servicing like apple does. customer service is utterly useless and does not treat you as a human being. waste of money. i like it but unfortunately it never picks up the stairs even if i'm walking up 8 floors. charge 4 lasted 2 year, the plastic connection bit on the side of the fitbit that clips onto your strap snapped off. charge 2 stopped working after 2 year also. i have a fitbit versa 3. it is literally the worst health and lifestyle watch in the history of mankind. the versa 3 loses gps signal in the countryside, in built up areas, in residential areas, basically everywhere. it then uses some ridiculous algorithm to work out what you've done whilst the signal was lost. pathetic. do not buy. Tried to return the fitbit as under warranty involves printing off a trees worth of paper in consignment notes etc. You have to go on hold to the courier company selected by google within australia. Nearly an hour later someone picks up and agrees you can’t do this online and they book you a pick up slot. However that window at your home address is between 9am and 5pm and you have to be home as they won't just pick it up. i see myself and many others have their fitbit account hacked. some of the responses on their helpcenter goes to say that the customer read the email wrong which is kind of funny. i recommend a garmin watch, their software is also very good and can link up to other third party apps. Customer service is a joke. never ending runaround just to get a replacement for a defective versa 3. shambles of a device. didn't last 18 months and they expect me to buy a new one at 35% discount. absolute joke. don't buy these products, they aren't made to last. Had a charge 4 and it performed pretty well apart from it not linking up with my phone after a period and then the bit that attached to the strap snapped and it was no longer usable. Was still in warranty but to try and contact fitbit to replace the product is a joke. i won't be buying a fitbit again. i can no longer scan a barcode on, say, a loaf of bread without signing up for their premium service. what a joke! i won't be using this app again. so long, mFP!"

Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

Please submit your best shots of New York for next week. Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of snapshots. Two watches (charge 4 and 5) died right after one year of normal wear, not even exercising, or in the shower. all they offer was 35% off. doesn't even offer servicing like apple does. customer service is utterly useless and does not treat you as a human being. waste of money. i like it but unfortunately it never picks up the stairs even if i'm walking up 8 floors. charge 4 lasted 2 year, the plastic connection bit on the side of the fitbit that clips onto your strap snapped off. charge 2 stopped working after 2 year also. i have a fitbit versa 3. it is literally the worst health and lifestyle watch in the history of mankind. the versa 3 loses gps signal in the countryside, in built up areas, in residential areas, basically everywhere. it then uses some ridiculous algorithm to work out what you've done whilst the signal was lost. pathetic. do not buy. Tried to return the fitbit as under warranty involves printing off a trees worth of paper in consignment notes etc. You have to go on hold to the courier company selected by google within australia. Nearly an hour later someone picks up and agrees you can’t do this online and they book you a pick up slot. However that window at your home address is between 9am and 5pm and you have to be home as they won't just pick it up. i see myself and many others have their fitbit account hacked. some of the responses on their helpcenter goes to say that the customer read the email wrong which is kind of funny. i recommend a garmin watch, their software is also very good and can link up to other third party apps. Customer service is a joke. never ending runaround just to get a replacement for a defective versa 3. shambles of a device. didn't last 18 months and they expect me to buy a new one at 35% discount. absolute joke. don't buy these products, they aren't made to last. Had a charge 4 and it performed pretty well apart from it not linking up with my phone after a period and then the bit that attached to the strap snapped and it was no longer usable. Was still in warranty but to try and contact fitbit to replace the product is a joke. i won't be buying a fitbit again. i can no longer scan a barcode on, say, a loaf of bread without signing up for their premium service. what a joke! i won't be using this app again. so long, mFP!"

customer service not fit for purpose.  my fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.   i believe this is a common occurrence. ,customer service fit purpose fitbit failed warranty said would replace attempt get replacement failed believe common occurrence,NEGATIVE,,customer service fit purpose fitbit failed warranty said would replace attempt get replacement failed believe common occurrence,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

Sleep tracking is excellent, easy to use with a simple to learn ui. battery life is brilliant, last several days! superb fitness trackers with a very competitive prices. charge 5 worked perfectly and now i am on charge 6, which is just as good with a minor improvements, all adds up to very smooth user experience. great app for cyclists! it's my every day app for recording my sports activities. the segments feature is super addictive. no problem to pay 59 usd per year for it. keep up the good job by continuously adding features! great product and social experience with a positive effect. Each email takes 3-5 working days to get a response, and in my case the support agent took two of those emails to ask the same question twice (adding 10 days to the resolution) it took weeks to resolve a basic problem. a few months back i started tracking my walks. i do 2 miles a day minimum, and just being able to see all the data set me on my journey to lose weight and get fitter. i now use strava, and garmin app together. very good app. i can build my cycling routes easily and also share them with my fellow-cyclists. strava can connect with multiple cycling computers even those that are sold on aliexpress. which makes it easier to follow the routes i build in the strava app. i have been using strava for nearly 3 years. it's great an compatible with my apple watch. i have rated it 4 stars because the have removed feature, making them ""summit"" (premium) features. i use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great. excellent performance but the app hcrashes too much no, put a fix on it. only using the free app version so far for my runs and i really like it.  give it a go. Great website for tracking fitness activities. they could do with more premium features for runners. the site seems very geared towards cyclists. it's a great app, with information that can help people through any type of fitness journey. i appreciate the notifications throughout the day to log my meals. it's super easy to look up the foods i have either by the search bar or barcode. i'd like to see more nutrients/minerals in the nutrient breakdown tab. also less ads would be nice. App has helped me lose weight, eat better, exercise more, reach my goals and stay on track/maintain. great database for tracking food at meals, integration of data to/from other health apps and devices, nice goal setting/tracking features. Great app to track your calories and workouts! searching for food, it is a very thorough and complete database and very easy to find what you need for quick logins. The ability to make and save recipes is a great asset to the app! i've had for 3 years and it's been of invaluable help with my bulking and cutting bodybuilding cycles. brilliant bar code facility. would love if it was possible to duplicate items for multiple meals and days but other than that very user friendly. i’ve used this as a valuable tool to track my calories for the past 8 years. i like that u can put exercises in too. it helps to keep track of the days i exercise, all in one app. i'm amazed by how many foods are in the data bank. if the food i want is not there, i can usually find one similar. the posted columns are very useful and helpful. i especially like the recipes. It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what i'm eating. shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of premium for a pensioner is a little steep. Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight excellent app. taught me well about macro nutrition facts. it’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the upc - only accessible via the paid app. that was a greedy move. This app has helped me on my way of losing 38 pounds in about 3 months! tracking my food and nutritional values has led me to lose 95 lbs. i feel great, too! used for years!! great for calorie counting and keeping track of my nutrition values. Great app easy to use and excellent for daily use. so far the app has helped me lose 18 ibsbrilliant  it is easy to log your foods. has info on many foods and restaurants. great tool. helps me keep track of meals well. excellent as always the best app to use good app. easy to use  used this for years. fantastic my trainer arman at 24 our fitness set this app up for me so that i could track my progress. i also like the articles on recipes and nutritional information, and sometimes i try to make the dishes. the ability to find specific foods from stores and restaurants makes it easy to do your daily check in. another great feature is the bar code reader, meaning less typing. Great app, keeps me honest! really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. beautiful product with many options to assess your meals. i started using the app after a heart attack. i use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. it's great.

Sleep tracking is excellent, easy to use with a simple to learn ui. battery life is brilliant, last several days! superb fitness trackers with a very competitive prices. charge 5 worked perfectly and now i am on charge 6, which is just as good with a minor improvements, all adds up to very smooth user experience. great app for cyclists! it's my every day app for recording my sports activities. the segments feature is super addictive. no problem to pay 59 usd per year for it. keep up the good job by continuously adding features! great product and social experience with a positive effect. Each email takes 3-5 working days to get a response, and in my case the support agent took two of those emails to ask the same question twice (adding 10 days to the resolution) it took weeks to resolve a basic problem. a few months back i started tracking my walks. i do 2 miles a day minimum, and just being able to see all the data set me on my journey to lose weight and get fitter. i now use strava, and garmin app together. very good app. i can build my cycling routes easily and also share them with my fellow-cyclists. strava can connect with multiple cycling computers even those that are sold on aliexpress. which makes it easier to follow the routes i build in the strava app. i have been using strava for nearly 3 years. it's great an compatible with my apple watch. i have rated it 4 stars because the have removed feature, making them ""summit"" (premium) features. i use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great. excellent performance but the app hcrashes too much no, put a fix on it. only using the free app version so far for my runs and i really like it.  give it a go. Great website for tracking fitness activities. they could do with more premium features for runners. the site seems very geared towards cyclists. it's a great app, with information that can help people through any type of fitness journey. i appreciate the notifications throughout the day to log my meals. it's super easy to look up the foods i have either by the search bar or barcode. i'd like to see more nutrients/minerals in the nutrient breakdown tab. also less ads would be nice. App has helped me lose weight, eat better, exercise more, reach my goals and stay on track/maintain. great database for tracking food at meals, integration of data to/from other health apps and devices, nice goal setting/tracking features. Great app to track your calories and workouts! searching for food, it is a very thorough and complete database and very easy to find what you need for quick logins. The ability to make and save recipes is a great asset to the app! i've had for 3 years and it's been of invaluable help with my bulking and cutting bodybuilding cycles. brilliant bar code facility. would love if it was possible to duplicate items for multiple meals and days but other than that very user friendly. i’ve used this as a valuable tool to track my calories for the past 8 years. i like that u can put exercises in too. it helps to keep track of the days i exercise, all in one app. i'm amazed by how many foods are in the data bank. if the food i want is not there, i can usually find one similar. the posted columns are very useful and helpful. i especially like the recipes. It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what i'm eating. shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of premium for a pensioner is a little steep. Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight excellent app. taught me well about macro nutrition facts. it’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the upc - only accessible via the paid app. that was a greedy move. This app has helped me on my way of losing 38 pounds in about 3 months! tracking my food and nutritional values has led me to lose 95 lbs. i feel great, too! used for years!! great for calorie counting and keeping track of my nutrition values. Great app easy to use and excellent for daily use. so far the app has helped me lose 18 ibsbrilliant  it is easy to log your foods. has info on many foods and restaurants. great tool. helps me keep track of meals well. excellent as always the best app to use good app. easy to use  used this for years. fantastic my trainer arman at 24 our fitness set this app up for me so that i could track my progress. i also like the articles on recipes and nutritional information, and sometimes i try to make the dishes. the ability to find specific foods from stores and restaurants makes it easy to do your daily check in. another great feature is the bar code reader, meaning less typing. Great app, keeps me honest! really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. beautiful product with many options to assess your meals. i started using the app after a heart attack. i use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. it's great. The app helps me track my macros, so i can keep my protein and fat high and carbs low. functionality is great and relatively user friendly. the database often has any food i need. i've kept the extra weight off for 5 years now.  myfitnesspal is amazing! it has been a huge help in my weight loss journey. the food database is huge, and the barcode scanner makes logging meals super easy. it tracks my progress and syncs with my other fitness apps. highly recommend for anyone looking to get healthier!"

An expensive bit of kit, which has been reliable for the two years i have owned it. my really big concern is having spent a lot of money on its initial purchase to really benefit you have to then pay to use all the functions within the app. knowing what i know now in no way, shape or form would buy another fitbit. realistically at its purchase the complete and full app should come with it all included. i don’t get fooled twice and i hope none of you out there get fooled once. i’m writing this regarding a versa 4 my wife bought for me as a christmas gift in december 2022. this watch recently died and could not be reset, less than 6 months after warranty ended. fitbit support offered a 35% discount on a new one instead of replacing it.  don't buy this product or do so at your own risk.  fitbit charge5 stopped syncing with the mobile app 12apr 2024. i bought it in april 2023. i tried all the steps available online and on the fitbit community forum. nothing worked. 16 apr 2024 - i had a live chat with fitbit onine.

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
i have owned every version of the fitbit charge and loved them until google bought them out. i despise all the updates to the app. they are terrible. they look like they are going backwards with how to present data instead of more a more modern feel.  it’s sad that i can’t wait for this one to break so i can buy a something different and it will not be a google brand. i want. nothing to do with supporting there fitness watch brand. it’s awful. sorry you messed up a good product.   ,owned every version fitbit charge loved google bought despise update app terrible look like going backwards present data instead modern feel sad wait one break buy something different google brand want nothing supporting fitness watch brand awful sorry messed good product,NEGATIVE,,owned every version fitbit charge loved google bought despise update app terrible look like going backwards present data instead modern feel sad wait one break buy something different google brand want nothing supporting fitness watch brand awful sorry messed good product,sadness,

The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

Please submit your best shots of New York for next week. Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of snapshots. Two watches (charge 4 and 5) died right after one year of normal wear, not even exercising, or in the shower. all they offer was 35% off. doesn't even offer servicing like apple does. customer service is utterly useless and does not treat you as a human being. waste of money. i like it but unfortunately it never picks up the stairs even if i'm walking up 8 floors. charge 4 lasted 2 year, the plastic connection bit on the side of the fitbit that clips onto your strap snapped off. charge 2 stopped working after 2 year also. i have a fitbit versa 3. it is literally the worst health and lifestyle watch in the history of mankind. the versa 3 loses gps signal in the countryside, in built up areas, in residential areas, basically everywhere. it then uses some ridiculous algorithm to work out what you've done whilst the signal was lost. pathetic. do not buy. Tried to return the fitbit as under warranty involves printing off a trees worth of paper in consignment notes etc. You have to go on hold to the courier company selected by google within australia. Nearly an hour later someone picks up and agrees you can’t do this online and they book you a pick up slot. However that window at your home address is between 9am and 5pm and you have to be home as they won't just pick it up. i see myself and many others have their fitbit account hacked. some of the responses on their helpcenter goes to say that the customer read the email wrong which is kind of funny. i recommend a garmin watch, their software is also very good and can link up to other third party apps. Customer service is a joke. never ending runaround just to get a replacement for a defective versa 3. shambles of a device. didn't last 18 months and they expect me to buy a new one at 35% discount. absolute joke. don't buy these products, they aren't made to last. Had a charge 4 and it performed pretty well apart from it not linking up with my phone after a period and then the bit that attached to the strap snapped and it was no longer usable. Was still in warranty but to try and contact fitbit to replace the product is a joke. i won't be buying a fitbit again. i can no longer scan a barcode on, say, a loaf of bread without signing up for their premium service. what a joke! i won't be using this app again. so long, mFP!"

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"
i have had 3 fitbit charges none of which have made it past a year. the first fitbit replaced with fitbit charge 5. the third a replacement pebble. so i have had the same issue again with a black screen and no operating fitbit and despite contacting customer services they are saying that warranty expired and can only offer 35% off another fitbit. warranty only applies to the first fitbit despite the fact that none of the subsequent replacements have made it to 12 months. i quoted the sales of goods act in the uk which states electrical items sold should be fit for purpose and expected to last up to 6 years. i asked for my query to be escalated to their complaints department and was told they don't have one!! i asked for the persons name and told due to security couldn't give it to me. asked for the address for the uk fitbit and told they didn't know so fitbit your customer services is shocking your product clearly has issues as i have read lots of others with the same problems and clearly hiding behind the first warranty. i will never buy another and certainly won't be recommending. let's see if you have a business in 12 months as i read you are loosing staff at the top regularly!!!,fitbit charge none made past year first fitbit replaced fitbit charge third replacement pebble issue black screen operating fitbit despite contacting customer service saying warranty expired offer another fitbit warranty applies first fitbit despite fact none subsequent replacement made month quoted sale good act uk state electrical item sold fit purpose expected last year asked query escalated complaint department told one asked person name told due security could give asked address uk fitbit told know fitbit customer service shocking product clearly issue read lot others problem clearly hiding behind first warranty never buy another certainly wo recommending let see business month read loosing staff top regularly,NEGATIVE,,fitbit charge none made past year first fitbit replaced fitbit charge third replacement pebble issue black screen operating fitbit despite contacting customer service saying warranty expired offer another fitbit warranty applies first fitbit despite fact none subsequent replacement made month quoted sale good act uk state electrical item sold fit purpose expected last year asked query escalated complaint department told one asked person name told due security could give asked address uk fitbit told know fitbit customer service shocking product clearly issue read lot others problem clearly hiding behind first warranty never buy another certainly wo recommending let see business month read loosing staff top regularly,neutral,

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

Two watches (charge 4 and 5) died right after one year of normal wear, not even exercising, or in the shower. all they offer was 35% off. doesn't even offer servicing like apple does. customer service is utterly useless and does not treat you as a human being. waste of money. i like it but unfortunately it never picks up the stairs even if i'm walking up 8 floors. charge 4 lasted 2 year, the plastic connection bit on the side of the fitbit that clips onto your strap snapped off. charge 2 stopped working after 2 year also. i have a fitbit versa 3. it is literally the worst health and lifestyle watch in the history of mankind. the versa 3 loses gps signal in the countryside, in built up areas, in residential areas, basically everywhere. it then uses some ridiculous algorithm to work out what you've done whilst the signal was lost. pathetic. do not buy. Tried to return the fitbit as under warranty involves printing off a trees worth of paper in consignment notes etc. You have to go on hold to the courier company selected by google within australia. Nearly an hour later someone picks up and agrees you can’t do this online and they book you a pick up slot. However that window at your home address is between 9am and 5pm and you have to be home as they won't just pick it up. i see myself and many others have their fitbit account hacked. some of the responses on their helpcenter goes to say that the customer read the email wrong which is kind of funny. i recommend a garmin watch, their software is also very good and can link up to other third party apps. Customer service is a joke. never ending runaround just to get a replacement for a defective versa 3. shambles of a device. didn't last 18 months and they expect me to buy a new one at 35% discount. absolute joke. don't buy these products, they aren't made to last. Had a charge 4 and it performed pretty well apart from it not linking up with my phone after a period and then the bit that attached to the strap snapped and it was no longer usable. Was still in warranty but to try and contact fitbit to replace the product is a joke. i won't be buying a fitbit again. i can no longer scan a barcode on, say, a loaf of bread without signing up for their premium service. what a joke! i won't be using this app again. so long, mFP!"

The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

"despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration.  no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology.  never stops annoying me as it's rarely the same.  may seem like a minor issue but i just find it incredible in this day & age.  the other really unpredictable feature is oxygen saturation, because you can't control how/where your wrist rests while sleeping & i can't get a regular, daily assessment. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch to do this very thing.  many people have posted complaints about this issue & the response is always to move the watch higher on the wrist & sitting flat.  you can do this every night & still not get an sp02 reading!!  if a finger oxymeter works no problem, then why is fitbit so unreliable?!!

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry.

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account.

Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
heatmap has stopped working since the new year. this  facility is the main reason i subscribe. despite reporting this to them twice in the last week i’ve yet to get a response. added to this there’s now another issue where it’s not possible to ‘flag’ incorrect activities. the leaderboards are pointless due to the high level of cheating. surely strava should be able to spot when an activity is faster than world record pace and automatically flag it. i will not be renewing.update: over the past couple of days strava have been in touch and been helpful in resolving the problem. just annoying that it took 10 days before it was solved.,heatmap stopped working since new year facility main reason subscribe despite reporting twice last week yet get response added another issue possible flag incorrect activity leaderboards pointless due high level cheating surely strava able spot activity faster world record pace automatically flag past couple day strava touch helpful resolving problem annoying took day solved,NEGATIVE,,heatmap stopped working since new year facility main reason subscribe despite reporting twice last week yet get response added another issue possible flag incorrect activity leaderboards pointless due high level cheating surely strava able spot activity faster world record pace automatically flag past couple day strava touch helpful resolving problem annoying took day solved,neutral,

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money.

The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

Sleep tracking is excellent, easy to use with a simple to learn ui. battery life is brilliant, last several days! superb fitness trackers with a very competitive prices. charge 5 worked perfectly and now i am on charge 6, which is just as good with a minor improvements, all adds up to very smooth user experience. great app for cyclists! it's my every day app for recording my sports activities. the segments feature is super addictive. no problem to pay 59 usd per year for it. keep up the good job by continuously adding features! great product and social experience with a positive effect. Each email takes 3-5 working days to get a response, and in my case the support agent took two of those emails to ask the same question twice (adding 10 days to the resolution) it took weeks to resolve a basic problem. a few months back i started tracking my walks. i do 2 miles a day minimum, and just being able to see all the data set me on my journey to lose weight and get fitter. i now use strava, and garmin app together. very good app. i can build my cycling routes easily and also share them with my fellow-cyclists. strava can connect with multiple cycling computers even those that are sold on aliexpress. which makes it easier to follow the routes i build in the strava app. i have been using strava for nearly 3 years. it's great an compatible with my apple watch. i have rated it 4 stars because the have removed feature, making them ""summit"" (premium) features. i use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great. excellent performance but the app hcrashes too much no, put a fix on it. only using the free app version so far for my runs and i really like it.  give it a go. Great website for tracking fitness activities. they could do with more premium features for runners. the site seems very geared towards cyclists. it's a great app, with information that can help people through any type of fitness journey. i appreciate the notifications throughout the day to log my meals. it's super easy to look up the foods i have either by the search bar or barcode. i'd like to see more nutrients/minerals in the nutrient breakdown tab. also less ads would be nice. App has helped me lose weight, eat better, exercise more, reach my goals and stay on track/maintain. great database for tracking food at meals, integration of data to/from other health apps and devices, nice goal setting/tracking features. Great app to track your calories and workouts! searching for food, it is a very thorough and complete database and very easy to find what you need for quick logins. The ability to make and save recipes is a great asset to the app! i've had for 3 years and it's been of invaluable help with my bulking and cutting bodybuilding cycles. brilliant bar code facility. would love if it was possible to duplicate items for multiple meals and days but other than that very user friendly. i’ve used this as a valuable tool to track my calories for the past 8 years. i like that u can put exercises in too. it helps to keep track of the days i exercise, all in one app. i'm amazed by how many foods are in the data bank. if the food i want is not there, i can usually find one similar. the posted columns are very useful and helpful. i especially like the recipes. It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what i'm eating. shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of premium for a pensioner is a little steep. Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight excellent app. taught me well about macro nutrition facts. it’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the upc - only accessible via the paid app. that was a greedy move. This app has helped me on my way of losing 38 pounds in about 3 months! tracking my food and nutritional values has led me to lose 95 lbs. i feel great, too! used for years!! great for calorie counting and keeping track of my nutrition values. Great app easy to use and excellent for daily use. so far the app has helped me lose 18 ibsbrilliant  it is easy to log your foods. has info on many foods and restaurants. great tool. helps me keep track of meals well. excellent as always the best app to use good app. easy to use  used this for years. fantastic my trainer arman at 24 our fitness set this app up for me so that i could track my progress. i also like the articles on recipes and nutritional information, and sometimes i try to make the dishes. the ability to find specific foods from stores and restaurants makes it easy to do your daily check in. another great feature is the bar code reader, meaning less typing. Great app, keeps me honest! really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. beautiful product with many options to assess your meals. i started using the app after a heart attack. i use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. it's great. The app helps me track my macros, so i can keep my protein and fat high and carbs low. functionality is great and relatively user friendly. the database often has any food i need. i've kept the extra weight off for 5 years now.  myfitnesspal is amazing! it has been a huge help in my weight loss journey. the food database is huge, and the barcode scanner makes logging meals super easy. it tracks my progress and syncs with my other fitness apps. highly recommend for anyone looking to get healthier!"

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
"i accidentally bought an annual subscription plan. i quickly realized and sent strava support a refund request. after reading bad reviews on trustpilot and reddit about strava support, i must say i was sceptical of how long it would take, and if i would be getting a full refund. strava support proved me wrong. fast response time, a short and precise text from a supporter and a full refund. overall the app is great and summit is good for data hungry beginners. of course lacking bits here and there. most of the bad reviews are just people complaining about not cancelling auto-renewal after end free-trial, and calling it a scam. things that don't justify the product and strava support.keep up the good work strava and especially strava support.",accidentally bought annual subscription plan quickly realized sent strava support refund request reading bad review trustpilot reddit strava support must say sceptical long would take would getting full refund strava support proved wrong fast response time short precise text supporter full refund overall app great summit good data hungry beginner course lacking bit bad review people complaining cancelling end calling scam thing justify product strava good work strava especially strava support,NEGATIVE,,accidentally bought annual subscription plan quickly realized sent strava support refund request reading bad review trustpilot reddit strava support must say sceptical long would take would getting full refund strava support proved wrong fast response time short precise text supporter full refund overall app great summit good data hungry beginner course lacking bit bad review people complaining cancelling end calling scam thing justify product strava good work strava especially strava support,neutral,

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava.

There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them.

Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
great product and social experience with a positive effect! always enjoy tracking my routes and using the route building functionality to explore new trails/paths in my area. they have made some really good changes to the app and its well worth the subscription fee.,great product social experience positive effect always enjoy tracking route using route building functionality explore new area made really good change app well worth subscription fee,POSITIVE,great product social experience positive effect always enjoy tracking route using route building functionality explore new area made really good change app well worth subscription fee,,admiration,"Fitbit app used to be excellent. it is in decline unless you pay their monthly subscription! i paid £400 for a piece of tech and can only use its full potential if i keep paying! you can shove it fitbit, no doubt you are making fortunes using all the data you have on us too! i used to love my fitbit and have been a loyal customer for over a decade. the app was always great, simple to use, easy to read, good to see how you were doing over time. recently the app changed but the underlying sections remained usable, now the sleep app has been “updated” it is unusable. we comment but fitbit are ignoring us, time to look at other offerings. Sleep tracking is excellent, easy to use with a simple to learn ui. battery life is brilliant, last several days! superb fitness trackers with a very competitive prices. charge 5 worked perfectly and now i am on charge 6, which is just as good with a minor improvements, all adds up to very smooth user experience. great app for cyclists! it's my every day app for recording my sports activities. the segments feature is super addictive. no problem to pay 59 usd per year for it. keep up the good job by continuously adding features! great product and social experience with a positive effect. Each email takes 3-5 working days to get a response, and in my case the support agent took two of those emails to ask the same question twice (adding 10 days to the resolution) it took weeks to resolve a basic problem. a few months back i started tracking my walks. i do 2 miles a day minimum, and just being able to see all the data set me on my journey to lose weight and get fitter. i now use strava, and garmin app together. very good app. i can build my cycling routes easily and also share them with my fellow-cyclists. strava can connect with multiple cycling computers even those that are sold on aliexpress. which makes it easier to follow the routes i build in the strava app. i have been using strava for nearly 3 years. it's great an compatible with my apple watch. i have rated it 4 stars because the have removed feature, making them ""summit"" (premium) features. i use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great. excellent performance but the app hcrashes too much no, put a fix on it. only using the free app version so far for my runs and i really like it.  give it a go. Great website for tracking fitness activities. they could do with more premium features for runners. the site seems very geared towards cyclists. it's a great app, with information that can help people through any type of fitness journey. i appreciate the notifications throughout the day to log my meals. it's super easy to look up the foods i have either by the search bar or barcode. i'd like to see more nutrients/minerals in the nutrient breakdown tab. also less ads would be nice. App has helped me lose weight, eat better, exercise more, reach my goals and stay on track/maintain. great database for tracking food at meals, integration of data to/from other health apps and devices, nice goal setting/tracking features. Great app to track your calories and workouts! searching for food, it is a very thorough and complete database and very easy to find what you need for quick logins. The ability to make and save recipes is a great asset to the app! i've had for 3 years and it's been of invaluable help with my bulking and cutting bodybuilding cycles. brilliant bar code facility. would love if it was possible to duplicate items for multiple meals and days but other than that very user friendly. i’ve used this as a valuable tool to track my calories for the past 8 years. i like that u can put exercises in too. it helps to keep track of the days i exercise, all in one app. i'm amazed by how many foods are in the data bank. if the food i want is not there, i can usually find one similar. the posted columns are very useful and helpful. i especially like the recipes. It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what i'm eating. shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of premium for a pensioner is a little steep. Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight excellent app. taught me well about macro nutrition facts. it’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the upc - only accessible via the paid app. that was a greedy move. This app has helped me on my way of losing 38 pounds in about 3 months! tracking my food and nutritional values has led me to lose 95 lbs. i feel great, too! used for years!! great for calorie counting and keeping track of my nutrition values. Great app easy to use and excellent for daily use. so far the app has helped me lose 18 ibsbrilliant  it is easy to log your foods. has info on many foods and restaurants. great tool. helps me keep track of meals well. excellent as always the best app to use good app. easy to use  used this for years. fantastic my trainer arman at 24 our fitness set this app up for me so that i could track my progress. i also like the articles on recipes and nutritional information, and sometimes i try to make the dishes. the ability to find specific foods from stores and restaurants makes it easy to do your daily check in. another great feature is the bar code reader, meaning less typing. Great app, keeps me honest! really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. beautiful product with many options to assess your meals. i started using the app after a heart attack. i use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. it's great. The app helps me track my macros, so i can keep my protein and fat high and carbs low. functionality is great and relatively user friendly. the database often has any food i need. i've kept the extra weight off for 5 years now.  myfitnesspal is amazing! it has been a huge help in my weight loss journey. the food database is huge, and the barcode scanner makes logging meals super easy. it tracks my progress and syncs with my other fitness apps. highly recommend for anyone looking to get healthier!"

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account.

App has helped me lose weight, eat better, exercise more, reach my goals and stay on track/maintain. great database for tracking food at meals, integration of data to/from other health apps and devices, nice goal setting/tracking features. Great app to track your calories and workouts! searching for food, it is a very thorough and complete database and very easy to find what you need for quick logins. The ability to make and save recipes is a great asset to the app! i've had for 3 years and it's been of invaluable help with my bulking and cutting bodybuilding cycles. brilliant bar code facility. would love if it was possible to duplicate items for multiple meals and days but other than that very user friendly. i’ve used this as a valuable tool to track my calories for the past 8 years. i like that u can put exercises in too. it helps to keep track of the days i exercise, all in one app. i'm amazed by how many foods are in the data bank. if the food i want is not there, i can usually find one similar. the posted columns are very useful and helpful. i especially like the recipes. It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what i'm eating. shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of premium for a pensioner is a little steep. Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight excellent app. taught me well about macro nutrition facts. it’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the upc - only accessible via the paid app. that was a greedy move. This app has helped me on my way of losing 38 pounds in about 3 months! tracking my food and nutritional values has led me to lose 95 lbs. i feel great, too! used for years!! great for calorie counting and keeping track of my nutrition values. Great app easy to use and excellent for daily use. so far the app has helped me lose 18 ibsbrilliant  it is easy to log your foods. has info on many foods and restaurants. great tool. helps me keep track of meals well. excellent as always the best app to use good app. easy to use  used this for years. fantastic my trainer arman at 24 our fitness set this app up for me so that i could track my progress. i also like the articles on recipes and nutritional information, and sometimes i try to make the dishes. the ability to find specific foods from stores and restaurants makes it easy to do your daily check in. another great feature is the bar code reader, meaning less typing. Great app, keeps me honest! really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. beautiful product with many options to assess your meals. i started using the app after a heart attack. i use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. it's great. The app helps me track my macros, so i can keep my protein and fat high and carbs low. functionality is great and relatively user friendly. the database often has any food i need. i've kept the extra weight off for 5 years now.  myfitnesspal is amazing! it has been a huge help in my weight loss journey. the food database is huge, and the barcode scanner makes logging meals super easy. it tracks my progress and syncs with my other fitness apps. highly recommend for anyone looking to get healthier!"

A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"
"just had a brief look at the app, wasn't even aware i'd signed up for a subscription. did not give any bank details etc. they took £54 through googlepay, i was totally unaware they could do this, would not refund payment. be very careful if you use their app.",brief look app even aware signed subscription give bank detail etc took googlepay totally unaware could would refund payment careful use app,NEGATIVE,,brief look app even aware signed subscription give bank detail etc took googlepay totally unaware could would refund payment careful use app,caring,"i am too traumatized to go into detail. my advice is to steer clear of this company. dealing with customer services is a surreal experience. a trustscore of 1 out of 5 should tell you all you need to know. An expensive bit of kit, which has been reliable for the two years i have owned it. my really big concern is having spent a lot of money on its initial purchase to really benefit you have to then pay to use all the functions within the app. knowing what i know now in no way, shape or form would buy another fitbit. realistically at its purchase the complete and full app should come with it all included. i don’t get fooled twice and i hope none of you out there get fooled once. i’m writing this regarding a versa 4 my wife bought for me as a christmas gift in december 2022. this watch recently died and could not be reset, less than 6 months after warranty ended. fitbit support offered a 35% discount on a new one instead of replacing it.  don't buy this product or do so at your own risk.  fitbit charge5 stopped syncing with the mobile app 12apr 2024. i bought it in april 2023. i tried all the steps available online and on the fitbit community forum. nothing worked. 16 apr 2024 - i had a live chat with fitbit onine. They were helpful and my fitbit is nowsyncing with mobile app. i was totally unaware they could do this, would not refund payment. be very careful if you use their app. it keeps you healthy  you help me stay on track, easy to use. if yiy switch phone they won't honor it they blame it on apple very dissatisfied customer."
"i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage with his profile being up there.",want delete deceased husband strava profile account way get done unless join strava know two half year guy used cycle uncomfortable stage profile,NEGATIVE,,want delete deceased husband strava profile account way get done unless join strava know two half year guy used cycle uncomfortable stage profile,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

Sleep tracking is excellent, easy to use with a simple to learn ui. battery life is brilliant, last several days! superb fitness trackers with a very competitive prices. charge 5 worked perfectly and now i am on charge 6, which is just as good with a minor improvements, all adds up to very smooth user experience. great app for cyclists! it's my every day app for recording my sports activities. the segments feature is super addictive. no problem to pay 59 usd per year for it. keep up the good job by continuously adding features! great product and social experience with a positive effect. Each email takes 3-5 working days to get a response, and in my case the support agent took two of those emails to ask the same question twice (adding 10 days to the resolution) it took weeks to resolve a basic problem. a few months back i started tracking my walks. i do 2 miles a day minimum, and just being able to see all the data set me on my journey to lose weight and get fitter. i now use strava, and garmin app together. very good app. i can build my cycling routes easily and also share them with my fellow-cyclists. strava can connect with multiple cycling computers even those that are sold on aliexpress. which makes it easier to follow the routes i build in the strava app. i have been using strava for nearly 3 years. it's great an compatible with my apple watch. i have rated it 4 stars because the have removed feature, making them ""summit"" (premium) features. i use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great. excellent performance but the app hcrashes too much no, put a fix on it. only using the free app version so far for my runs and i really like it.  give it a go. Great website for tracking fitness activities. they could do with more premium features for runners. the site seems very geared towards cyclists. it's a great app, with information that can help people through any type of fitness journey. i appreciate the notifications throughout the day to log my meals. it's super easy to look up the foods i have either by the search bar or barcode. i'd like to see more nutrients/minerals in the nutrient breakdown tab. also less ads would be nice. App has helped me lose weight, eat better, exercise more, reach my goals and stay on track/maintain. great database for tracking food at meals, integration of data to/from other health apps and devices, nice goal setting/tracking features. Great app to track your calories and workouts! searching for food, it is a very thorough and complete database and very easy to find what you need for quick logins. The ability to make and save recipes is a great asset to the app! i've had for 3 years and it's been of invaluable help with my bulking and cutting bodybuilding cycles. brilliant bar code facility. would love if it was possible to duplicate items for multiple meals and days but other than that very user friendly. i’ve used this as a valuable tool to track my calories for the past 8 years. i like that u can put exercises in too. it helps to keep track of the days i exercise, all in one app. i'm amazed by how many foods are in the data bank. if the food i want is not there, i can usually find one similar. the posted columns are very useful and helpful. i especially like the recipes. It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what i'm eating. shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of premium for a pensioner is a little steep. Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight excellent app. taught me well about macro nutrition facts. it’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the upc - only accessible via the paid app. that was a greedy move. This app has helped me on my way of losing 38 pounds in about 3 months! tracking my food and nutritional values has led me to lose 95 lbs. i feel great, too! used for years!! great for calorie counting and keeping track of my nutrition values. Great app easy to use and excellent for daily use. so far the app has helped me lose 18 ibsbrilliant  it is easy to log your foods. has info on many foods and restaurants. great tool. helps me keep track of meals well. excellent as always the best app to use good app. easy to use  used this for years. fantastic my trainer arman at 24 our fitness set this app up for me so that i could track my progress. i also like the articles on recipes and nutritional information, and sometimes i try to make the dishes. the ability to find specific foods from stores and restaurants makes it easy to do your daily check in. another great feature is the bar code reader, meaning less typing. Great app, keeps me honest! really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. beautiful product with many options to assess your meals. i started using the app after a heart attack. i use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. it's great. The app helps me track my macros, so i can keep my protein and fat high and carbs low. functionality is great and relatively user friendly. the database often has any food i need. i've kept the extra weight off for 5 years now.  myfitnesspal is amazing! it has been a huge help in my weight loss journey. the food database is huge, and the barcode scanner makes logging meals super easy. it tracks my progress and syncs with my other fitness apps. highly recommend for anyone looking to get healthier!"

Please submit your best shots of New York for next week. Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of snapshots. i love fitbit and am obsessed with my watch. over the past 4 years my fitbit has stopped working twice and both times they ask me to send it back and have sent me a brand new one! not many companies would do that so i think it's great. i generally find it so great for tracking all my exercise too and there’s so much you can do on the app. i would never move to any other watch and always recommend them. my fitbit stopped working, customer service was useless and just offered me discount on a new purchase. when i asked how to make a complaint they went from replying promptly to completely ignoring me. i only wish i'd read the reviews years ago as i certainly would've avoided this company. i know they had a premium service that could go in depth but now all basic functions are behind that paywall. my advice: use a different app. used to be a great app, now they have changed it so you need to pay for the most basic of functions. The app runs well most of the time but sometimes doesn't work as well. other than the negative, a good app. they need to sort the money business out. sort it out strava! good at dealing with specific enquiries on rides, but there are some long highlighted general issues that have been raised many times by different people. happy with the overall use of the site via a pc, not so much so on the app. going the paid route opens up so much more and this is both insightful and in my case, helps motivate me. i find the menu easy to navigate, and the info on calories and nutrients is very helpful. search function in “add a food” has some incorrect calorie counts. system automatically adds my exercise calories to my daily total. i can’t opt out of that without upgrading to premium. i have been using myfitnesspal for many years and i had bariatric surgery 3 years ago and this is a very handy tool to use to track. what i used to like i was able to scan my food for free. however now i write my food in because for scanning it isn't free anymore. i still like tracking calories even though i write them in.  myfitnesspal has become my de facto way of keeping track of calories. its accurate, extremely easy to use and would be difficult to do without. this app has a very extensive data base so makes it easy to track my daily food intake. My fitness pal is a brilliant app for managing everything linked to a healthy lifestyle. it is easy to use and if you subscribe to the premium service then you get fantastic value for money. i personally use the basic service for free as my only requirement is the food diary. you will not be disappointed using my fitness pal, and i will guarantee that. i've been using this app to track workouts and meals for years. i trust its data more than any other app i've used. it’s app is easy to use and they everything imaginable listed! i still use the free app and am tempted to try the updated version. Myfitnesspal is right on. always room for improvement, especially for people who don't eat processed food. having to continually put in ingredients i choose to eat is somewhat challenging, especially since i often substitute the alternative ingredients in recipes. i use mFP to track my weight and calories, and it has helped me achieve my fitness goals through the years. fitness pal is easy to use, to check my daily nutrients (calories, carbs, fiber, etc). most of my meal choices are already included in the data. The app is easy to use and perfect for managing my fitness goals. easy ti use and upload myfeedback which was welcomed by the company i bought from. i've been using it consistently for past 2 months and i'm literally seeing the results on weekly basis. i have been using this app daily for over a year. the workout feature is hit and miss, but basically it works well. it’s easy to communicate with other bikers in the community and share experiences. This app is simple to use and really helps me stay on track. wo helpful and easy. it does what i need it to do when i use it right. it has what i want. i’m a long time user and credit my fitness pal with providing both information and the discipline needed to first lose weight and then maintain. i have many friends who complain about not being able to lose weight but have no clue about how many calories, carbs, fats etc they consume. additionally they don’t understand how few calories are actually needed by the human body per day or the amount of exercise needed per day. i was recently diagnosed with gallbladder and liver issues. myfitnesspal has made it much easier to visualize if i’m achieving my macro and nutrient goals for those conditions. with their premium features, it has been worth it! i like that i can scan food to get the nutrition info. i started the south beach diet at my dr’s recommendation and found it hard to find information within the app to follow it. good to count calories and keep trsvk. expensive to go premium."
"a reaaaal scam, i didn t even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my account, i didn t even fil anything, didn t put my credit card or anything, stay away from it as far as you can.i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account.",reaaaal scam even know thing taken account even fil anything put credit card anything stay away far cancel credit card took bit money everyday account,NEGATIVE,,reaaaal scam even know thing taken account even fil anything put credit card anything stay away far cancel credit card took bit money everyday account,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!!

Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

"absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother. ",absolute rubbish consistently fails track activity great straight line nowhere timing messed bother,NEGATIVE,,absolute rubbish consistently fails track activity great straight line nowhere timing messed bother,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money!

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

this is with regard to strava support.  have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member.  the app is mostly great.  however after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service.  have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days.  terrible customer service.,regard strava support using app year member app mostly great however renewing summit paying year suddenly lost access service sent help request far response day terrible customer service,NEGATIVE,,regard strava support using app year member app mostly great however renewing summit paying year suddenly lost access service sent help request far response day terrible customer service,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily.

they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money. they won't issue me a refund now. really angry.,underhandedly misleading pushed subscribing premium service realised going charged cancelled presciption would update took money wo issue refund really angry,NEGATIVE,,underhandedly misleading pushed subscribing premium service realised going charged cancelled presciption would update took money wo issue refund really angry,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

another good app that's ruined by greed. these premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra.,another good app ruined greed premium price crazy absolutely worth considering barely get anything extra,NEGATIVE,,another good app ruined greed premium price crazy absolutely worth considering barely get anything extra,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

strava used to be good but they do nothing about e bikes or rides being recorded as runs ruining the leaderboards. if you want to compete on climbs it is pointless as they could easily use an algorithm to detect e bikes or just give people a nudge if the activity looks incorrect. most people record what bike they used so even it is confidential to the user they could ask you to log if it is an e bike or regular bike. any city road leaderboard for runs is dominated by people on bikes. it used to be a good training tool to try and climb the leaderboard and compete with others but it is useless now. if there are 500 runners on a segment the top of the leaderboard is unlikely to be someone who's done their first 5km run and recorded it on an phone. this would be obvious to strava and they could just give you a prompt before you save the activity. then they started charging for the privilege and giving almost nothing back in return. they say you can flag an activity but it shouldn't be up to you to identify millions of wrong activity recordings. for these reasons i'll be getting rid of strava.,strava used good nothing e bike ride recorded run ruining leaderboards want compete climb pointless could easily use algorithm detect e bike give people nudge activity look incorrect people record bike used even confidential user could ask log e bike regular bike city road leaderboard run dominated people bike used good training tool try climb leaderboard compete others useless runner segment top leaderboard unlikely someone done first run recorded phone would obvious strava could give prompt save activity started charging privilege giving almost nothing back return say flag activity identify million wrong activity recording reason getting rid strava,NEGATIVE,,strava used good nothing e bike ride recorded run ruining leaderboards want compete climb pointless could easily use algorithm detect e bike give people nudge activity look incorrect people record bike used even confidential user could ask log e bike regular bike city road leaderboard run dominated people bike used good training tool try climb leaderboard compete others useless runner segment top leaderboard unlikely someone done first run recorded phone would obvious strava could give prompt save activity started charging privilege giving almost nothing back return say flag activity identify million wrong activity recording reason getting rid strava,neutral,

don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email. 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service.,launch massive marketing push staff deal expected rush sign ups upgraded membership unable access premium feature sent email week later sign reply really terrible customer service,NEGATIVE,,launch massive marketing push staff deal expected rush sign ups upgraded membership unable access premium feature sent email week later sign reply really terrible customer service,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

"terrible from the very beginning. as countless other people have stated strava has no customer services department. i’m not being dramatic they literally have nobody working in customer support. queries, questions, suggestions and complaints are all ignored. there is no contact number of course (why would there be when there is nobody working there) so the only way to get in touch is by email which of course has nobody attending the mailbox. the app itself has a terrible user interface. it’s almost impossible to find and follow people you know even when you try to sync contacts or friends on facebook it’s still impossible to find anyone. recording of activities is more often than not incorrect, with huge straight lines that you never walked/ran or your entire activity is in zig zag lines making it look like you’ve travelled more distance than you have. it’s really just a very very bad app through and through. there are countless better apps out there for free. do not waste you’re time with strava",terrible beginning countless people stated strava customer service department dramatic literally nobody working customer support query question suggestion complaint ignored contact number course would nobody working way get touch email course nobody attending mailbox app terrible user interface almost impossible find follow people know even try sync contact friend facebook still impossible find anyone recording activity often incorrect huge straight line never entire activity zig zag line making look like travelled distance really bad app countless better apps free waste time strava,NEGATIVE,,terrible beginning countless people stated strava customer service department dramatic literally nobody working customer support query question suggestion complaint ignored contact number course would nobody working way get touch email course nobody attending mailbox app terrible user interface almost impossible find follow people know even try sync contact friend facebook still impossible find anyone recording activity often incorrect huge straight line never entire activity zig zag line making look like travelled distance really bad app countless better apps free waste time strava,disapproval,

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides.

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

Please submit your best shots of New York for next week. Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of snapshots. i’ve tried contacting fitbit twice over the last month and nobody has bothered to acknowledge either of my emails. the warranty is absolutely useless if nobody is there to fix an issue when it presents. i don’t know how such an established business is allowed to operate like this with no accountability. i will definitely go to a competitor who can be trusted to honour a warranty. i've been a fitbit customer for years and have always been really happy but since this merger with google their customer service has really gone downhill. my fitbit has just broken but is within warranty. last time this happened i just got on to customer services and they sorted me a new one before the end of the day. this morning i've spent 2 hours on customer services unable to verify my account because it's not with registered with google. the person kept telling me it was my fault and there was nothing they could do. not sure what to do now and fitbit don't seem interested in trying to help or retain me as a customer. i don't know what happened to fitbit.  now you have to order through the google store- beware you can’t return orders. i am out over $100 and no o w will get back to me!!!! it was free before, but now all main core features are under subscription. i have a free account in the uk, which i’ve never paid for. i used it twice in san francisco for two bike rides and strava have charges me two lots of £47.99 on the same day!! the app never asked for permission or credit card details. they just helped themselves to my money. i really don't know how!i will be cancelling my account and reporting the fraudulent transaction to my credit card provider. avoid!! i inadvertently bought a 14 month subscription thinking it was a free trial (the get two months free causing the confusion) however the response to my email (cancelling my paid for subscription and sorting out a refund) was done quickly and without any fuss. only feedback to strava, maybe think about how promotions are worded to avoid confusion in the future."

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it.

"clearly strava have no intentions to really support sports other than swimming, cycling and running as complaints about the lack of information delivered for all other sports options can be traced back around 5 years at least. seems to me that advertising strava for any other sports is really false advertising because we can't extract much meaningful data from non-strava sports. there is not even a distinction between off-road and on-road running/cycling, or pool/open water swimming which are very different sports in their performance elements. splitting, e.g. watersports into the various components is obviously just a lame attempt to disguise the fact that strava don't care. if they were prepared to support watersports they should devote the same detail to them as their core sports instead of providing a token option. further evidence of their lack of interest is evident in the extremely limited options for clubs to build leader boards. all up, very poorly done strava. i can see why so many athletes are no longer using your platform when i look across the opposition offerings.",clearly strava intention really support sport swimming cycling running complaint lack information delivered sport option traced back around year least seems advertising strava sport really false advertising ca extract much meaningful data sport even distinction water swimming different sport performance element splitting watersports various component obviously lame attempt disguise fact strava care prepared support watersports devote detail core sport instead providing token option evidence lack interest evident extremely limited option club build leader board poorly done strava see many athlete longer using platform look across opposition offering,NEGATIVE,,clearly strava intention really support sport swimming cycling running complaint lack information delivered sport option traced back around year least seems advertising strava sport really false advertising ca extract much meaningful data sport even distinction water swimming different sport performance element splitting watersports various component obviously lame attempt disguise fact strava care prepared support watersports devote detail core sport instead providing token option evidence lack interest evident extremely limited option club build leader board poorly done strava see many athlete longer using platform look across opposition offering,neutral,

Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact!

very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! ,disappointing miss ride day stop buy water app still running every day rong data pay year fouled,NEGATIVE,,disappointing miss ride day stop buy water app still running every day rong data pay year fouled,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
"watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values  - annoying. shut down of ""fly by"" is a huge mistake",never corollate garmin trainingpeaks value annoying shut fly huge mistake,NEGATIVE,,never corollate garmin trainingpeaks value annoying shut fly huge mistake,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better!

The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
"i've been using strava for several years.  i've enjoyed recording trips, and use it for my all of my cycling, and interesting walking (esp. overseas, where i'm not always sure where i am).  i have about 20,000 km of records stored in strava.about 3 years ago i subscribed so that i could share my path in real time with my kids using the tracker feature.  it was also a safety feature, as i often ride or walk solo, and sometimes in remote and adventurous places.so far - excellent.when strava increased the subscription by approx 500% (yes, really - **500%**), i cancelled because i don't need tracker so much as i do overseas.pain - i can't compare my rides with friends and within my club.pain - i keep getting hassled by strava to subscribe.horror - today i find that i no longer have access to the dozens of my carefully planned routes.  it took me many, many hours of work to create those routes.  no warning from strava that they would ever require a subscription to access.  i'm the author of those routes and they are my intellectual property.  in my opinion, what strava is doing is the same business model as ransomeware: to block a user's access to their work until a subscription/ransom is paid.i can't find it in my heart to send a subscription to such an unethical company, so will have to work at rebuilding all of my routes in another app.  fortunately, strava's route creator is no better than free apps.",using strava several year enjoyed recording trip use cycling interesting walking esp overseas always sure km record stored year ago subscribed could share path real time kid using tracker feature also safety feature often ride walk solo sometimes remote adventurous far strava increased subscription approx yes really cancelled need tracker much ca compare ride friend within keep getting hassled strava today find longer access dozen carefully planned route took many many hour work create route warning strava would ever require subscription access author route intellectual property opinion strava business model ransomeware block user access work ca find heart send subscription unethical company work rebuilding route another app fortunately strava route creator better free apps,NEGATIVE,,using strava several year enjoyed recording trip use cycling interesting walking esp overseas always sure km record stored year ago subscribed could share path real time kid using tracker feature also safety feature often ride walk solo sometimes remote adventurous far strava increased subscription approx yes really cancelled need tracker much ca compare ride friend within keep getting hassled strava today find longer access dozen carefully planned route took many many hour work create route warning strava would ever require subscription access author route intellectual property opinion strava business model ransomeware block user access work ca find heart send subscription unethical company work rebuilding route another app fortunately strava route creator better free apps,neutral,

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine.

Please submit your best shots of New York for next week. Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of snapshots. i love fitbit and am obsessed with my watch. over the past 4 years my fitbit has stopped working twice and both times they ask me to send it back and have sent me a brand new one! not many companies would do that so i think it's great. i generally find it so great for tracking all my exercise too and there’s so much you can do on the app. i would never move to any other watch and always recommend them. my fitbit stopped working, customer service was useless and just offered me discount on a new purchase. when i asked how to make a complaint they went from replying promptly to completely ignoring me. i only wish i'd read the reviews years ago as i certainly would've avoided this company. i know they had a premium service that could go in depth but now all basic functions are behind that paywall. my advice: use a different app. used to be a great app, now they have changed it so you need to pay for the most basic of functions. The app runs well most of the time but sometimes doesn't work as well. other than the negative, a good app. they need to sort the money business out. sort it out strava! good at dealing with specific enquiries on rides, but there are some long highlighted general issues that have been raised many times by different people. happy with the overall use of the site via a pc, not so much so on the app. going the paid route opens up so much more and this is both insightful and in my case, helps motivate me. i find the menu easy to navigate, and the info on calories and nutrients is very helpful. search function in “add a food” has some incorrect calorie counts. system automatically adds my exercise calories to my daily total. i can’t opt out of that without upgrading to premium. i have been using myfitnesspal for many years and i had bariatric surgery 3 years ago and this is a very handy tool to use to track. what i used to like i was able to scan my food for free. however now i write my food in because for scanning it isn't free anymore. i still like tracking calories even though i write them in.  myfitnesspal has become my de facto way of keeping track of calories. its accurate, extremely easy to use and would be difficult to do without. this app has a very extensive data base so makes it easy to track my daily food intake. My fitness pal is a brilliant app for managing everything linked to a healthy lifestyle. it is easy to use and if you subscribe to the premium service then you get fantastic value for money. i personally use the basic service for free as my only requirement is the food diary. you will not be disappointed using my fitness pal, and i will guarantee that. i've been using this app to track workouts and meals for years. i trust its data more than any other app i've used. it’s app is easy to use and they everything imaginable listed! i still use the free app and am tempted to try the updated version. Myfitnesspal is right on. always room for improvement, especially for people who don't eat processed food. having to continually put in ingredients i choose to eat is somewhat challenging, especially since i often substitute the alternative ingredients in recipes. i use mFP to track my weight and calories, and it has helped me achieve my fitness goals through the years. fitness pal is easy to use, to check my daily nutrients (calories, carbs, fiber, etc). most of my meal choices are already included in the data. The app is easy to use and perfect for managing my fitness goals. easy ti use and upload myfeedback which was welcomed by the company i bought from. i've been using it consistently for past 2 months and i'm literally seeing the results on weekly basis. i have been using this app daily for over a year. the workout feature is hit and miss, but basically it works well. it’s easy to communicate with other bikers in the community and share experiences. This app is simple to use and really helps me stay on track. wo helpful and easy. it does what i need it to do when i use it right. it has what i want. i’m a long time user and credit my fitness pal with providing both information and the discipline needed to first lose weight and then maintain. i have many friends who complain about not being able to lose weight but have no clue about how many calories, carbs, fats etc they consume. additionally they don’t understand how few calories are actually needed by the human body per day or the amount of exercise needed per day. i was recently diagnosed with gallbladder and liver issues. myfitnesspal has made it much easier to visualize if i’m achieving my macro and nutrient goals for those conditions. with their premium features, it has been worth it! i like that i can scan food to get the nutrition info. i started the south beach diet at my dr’s recommendation and found it hard to find information within the app to follow it. good to count calories and keep trsvk. expensive to go premium."
i use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great.,use almost daily apart dodgy route planner find website app interface great,POSITIVE,use almost daily apart dodgy route planner find website app interface great,,admiration,"Fitbit app used to be excellent. it is in decline unless you pay their monthly subscription! i paid £400 for a piece of tech and can only use its full potential if i keep paying! you can shove it fitbit, no doubt you are making fortunes using all the data you have on us too! i used to love my fitbit and have been a loyal customer for over a decade. the app was always great, simple to use, easy to read, good to see how you were doing over time. recently the app changed but the underlying sections remained usable, now the sleep app has been “updated” it is unusable. we comment but fitbit are ignoring us, time to look at other offerings. Sleep tracking is excellent, easy to use with a simple to learn ui. battery life is brilliant, last several days! superb fitness trackers with a very competitive prices. charge 5 worked perfectly and now i am on charge 6, which is just as good with a minor improvements, all adds up to very smooth user experience. great app for cyclists! it's my every day app for recording my sports activities. the segments feature is super addictive. no problem to pay 59 usd per year for it. keep up the good job by continuously adding features! great product and social experience with a positive effect. Each email takes 3-5 working days to get a response, and in my case the support agent took two of those emails to ask the same question twice (adding 10 days to the resolution) it took weeks to resolve a basic problem. a few months back i started tracking my walks. i do 2 miles a day minimum, and just being able to see all the data set me on my journey to lose weight and get fitter. i now use strava, and garmin app together. very good app. i can build my cycling routes easily and also share them with my fellow-cyclists. strava can connect with multiple cycling computers even those that are sold on aliexpress. which makes it easier to follow the routes i build in the strava app. i have been using strava for nearly 3 years. it's great an compatible with my apple watch. i have rated it 4 stars because the have removed feature, making them ""summit"" (premium) features. i use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great. excellent performance but the app hcrashes too much no, put a fix on it. only using the free app version so far for my runs and i really like it.  give it a go. Great website for tracking fitness activities. they could do with more premium features for runners. the site seems very geared towards cyclists. it's a great app, with information that can help people through any type of fitness journey. i appreciate the notifications throughout the day to log my meals. it's super easy to look up the foods i have either by the search bar or barcode. i'd like to see more nutrients/minerals in the nutrient breakdown tab. also less ads would be nice. App has helped me lose weight, eat better, exercise more, reach my goals and stay on track/maintain. great database for tracking food at meals, integration of data to/from other health apps and devices, nice goal setting/tracking features. Great app to track your calories and workouts! searching for food, it is a very thorough and complete database and very easy to find what you need for quick logins. The ability to make and save recipes is a great asset to the app! i've had for 3 years and it's been of invaluable help with my bulking and cutting bodybuilding cycles. brilliant bar code facility. would love if it was possible to duplicate items for multiple meals and days but other than that very user friendly. i’ve used this as a valuable tool to track my calories for the past 8 years. i like that u can put exercises in too. it helps to keep track of the days i exercise, all in one app. i'm amazed by how many foods are in the data bank. if the food i want is not there, i can usually find one similar. the posted columns are very useful and helpful. i especially like the recipes. It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what i'm eating. shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of premium for a pensioner is a little steep. Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight excellent app. taught me well about macro nutrition facts. it’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the upc - only accessible via the paid app. that was a greedy move. This app has helped me on my way of losing 38 pounds in about 3 months! tracking my food and nutritional values has led me to lose 95 lbs. i feel great, too! used for years!! great for calorie counting and keeping track of my nutrition values. Great app easy to use and excellent for daily use. so far the app has helped me lose 18 ibsbrilliant  it is easy to log your foods. has info on many foods and restaurants. great tool. helps me keep track of meals well. excellent as always the best app to use good app. easy to use  used this for years. fantastic my trainer arman at 24 our fitness set this app up for me so that i could track my progress. i also like the articles on recipes and nutritional information, and sometimes i try to make the dishes. the ability to find specific foods from stores and restaurants makes it easy to do your daily check in. another great feature is the bar code reader, meaning less typing. Great app, keeps me honest! really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. beautiful product with many options to assess your meals. i started using the app after a heart attack. i use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. it's great. The app helps me track my macros, so i can keep my protein and fat high and carbs low. functionality is great and relatively user friendly. the database often has any food i need. i've kept the extra weight off for 5 years now.  myfitnesspal is amazing! it has been a huge help in my weight loss journey. the food database is huge, and the barcode scanner makes logging meals super easy. it tracks my progress and syncs with my other fitness apps. highly recommend for anyone looking to get healthier!"
getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe.  constant emails asking to subscribe.,getting fed harassed subscribe constant email asking subscribe,NEGATIVE,,getting fed harassed subscribe constant email asking subscribe,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

"this app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible.",app stopped recording run paid full version still continue fail terrible,NEGATIVE,,app stopped recording run paid full version still continue fail terrible,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

the app is constantly crashing. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. waste of money. will not be renewing,app constantly crashing ride recorded one waste money renewing,NEGATIVE,,app constantly crashing ride recorded one waste money renewing,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"
"i was looking for an alternative to the very unstable endomondo, and was told that strava was the way to go.i use a garmin watch as my tracker unit and through that i use garmin connect to analyse my runs.endomondo and now strava should be my backup-place, so i would have all my activivities in a unit-independent place if i later on got a new running watch from another brand.i said yes to get 2 month for free, and now i was ready to move all my data from endomondo to strava. but...for some weird reason strava has a limitation on uploading activities manually. it will take forever to move all my history from endomondo.next i found out that strava is all about competing with others through segments and thophies. i'm not into that - i compete against myself.okay then... if only strava could give a good overview over my personal records based on my activities. but... no. you have to enter pr's manually. what!? why on earth should you do that? i have several routes that i sometimes run one way around - and sometimes the other way around. can strava then tell me what way i have run? no! they don't put km-markers on the map... very basic feature, that all other running apps have.i can see that a feature-request have been made for this back in 2017 - and nothing has happened.i'm skipping strava again... and hopefully endomondo will start being more stable again.",looking alternative unstable endomondo told strava way use garmin watch tracker unit use garmin connect analyse strava would activivities place later got new running watch another said yes get month free ready move data endomondo strava weird reason strava limitation uploading activity manually take forever move history found strava competing others segment thophies compete strava could give good overview personal record based activity enter pr manually earth several route sometimes run one way around sometimes way around strava tell way run put map basic feature running apps see made back nothing skipping strava hopefully endomondo start stable,NEGATIVE,,looking alternative unstable endomondo told strava way use garmin watch tracker unit use garmin connect analyse strava would activivities place later got new running watch another said yes get month free ready move data endomondo strava weird reason strava limitation uploading activity manually take forever move history found strava competing others segment thophies compete strava could give good overview personal record based activity enter pr manually earth several route sometimes run one way around sometimes way around strava tell way run put map basic feature running apps see made back nothing skipping strava hopefully endomondo start stable,neutral,

"shocking customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work, wanted to give back but they refuse to refund!",shocking customer service premium subscription gift activated month buggy work wanted give back refuse refund,NEGATIVE,,shocking customer service premium subscription gift activated month buggy work wanted give back refuse refund,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

Each email takes 3-5 working days to get a response, and in my case the support agent took two of those emails to ask the same question twice (adding 10 days to the resolution) it took weeks to resolve a basic problem. a few months back i started tracking my walks. i do 2 miles a day minimum, and just being able to see all the data set me on my journey to lose weight and get fitter. i now use strava, and garmin app together. very good app. i can build my cycling routes easily and also share them with my fellow-cyclists. strava can connect with multiple cycling computers even those that are sold on aliexpress. which makes it easier to follow the routes i build in the strava app. i have been using strava for nearly 3 years. it's great an compatible with my apple watch. i have rated it 4 stars because the have removed feature, making them ""summit"" (premium) features. i use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great. excellent performance but the app hcrashes too much no, put a fix on it. only using the free app version so far for my runs and i really like it.  give it a go. Great website for tracking fitness activities. they could do with more premium features for runners. the site seems very geared towards cyclists. it's a great app, with information that can help people through any type of fitness journey. i appreciate the notifications throughout the day to log my meals. it's super easy to look up the foods i have either by the search bar or barcode. i'd like to see more nutrients/minerals in the nutrient breakdown tab. also less ads would be nice. App has helped me lose weight, eat better, exercise more, reach my goals and stay on track/maintain. great database for tracking food at meals, integration of data to/from other health apps and devices, nice goal setting/tracking features. Great app to track your calories and workouts! searching for food, it is a very thorough and complete database and very easy to find what you need for quick logins. The ability to make and save recipes is a great asset to the app! i've had for 3 years and it's been of invaluable help with my bulking and cutting bodybuilding cycles. brilliant bar code facility. would love if it was possible to duplicate items for multiple meals and days but other than that very user friendly. i’ve used this as a valuable tool to track my calories for the past 8 years. i like that u can put exercises in too. it helps to keep track of the days i exercise, all in one app. i'm amazed by how many foods are in the data bank. if the food i want is not there, i can usually find one similar. the posted columns are very useful and helpful. i especially like the recipes. It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what i'm eating. shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of premium for a pensioner is a little steep. Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight excellent app. taught me well about macro nutrition facts. it’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the upc - only accessible via the paid app. that was a greedy move. This app has helped me on my way of losing 38 pounds in about 3 months! tracking my food and nutritional values has led me to lose 95 lbs. i feel great, too! used for years!! great for calorie counting and keeping track of my nutrition values. Great app easy to use and excellent for daily use. so far the app has helped me lose 18 ibsbrilliant  it is easy to log your foods. has info on many foods and restaurants. great tool. helps me keep track of meals well. excellent as always the best app to use good app. easy to use  used this for years. fantastic my trainer arman at 24 our fitness set this app up for me so that i could track my progress. i also like the articles on recipes and nutritional information, and sometimes i try to make the dishes. the ability to find specific foods from stores and restaurants makes it easy to do your daily check in. another great feature is the bar code reader, meaning less typing. Great app, keeps me honest! really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. beautiful product with many options to assess your meals. i started using the app after a heart attack. i use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. it's great. The app helps me track my macros, so i can keep my protein and fat high and carbs low. functionality is great and relatively user friendly. the database often has any food i need. i've kept the extra weight off for 5 years now.  myfitnesspal is amazing! it has been a huge help in my weight loss journey. the food database is huge, and the barcode scanner makes logging meals super easy. it tracks my progress and syncs with my other fitness apps. highly recommend for anyone looking to get healthier!"

"all the features are paywalled it used to be better, now its scam",feature paywalled used better scam,NEGATIVE,,feature paywalled used better scam,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!!

The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

"i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. i don't want to see any names i don't know in the app. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me i should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to give kudos to. no way!",sick tired strava telling give kudos want see name know app intrusion privacy people know adam telling give kudos weird let get straight suppose pay app tell give kudos way,NEGATIVE,,sick tired strava telling give kudos want see name know app intrusion privacy people know adam telling give kudos weird let get straight suppose pay app tell give kudos way,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"
only using the free app version so far for my runs and i really like it. its a bit of fun and has great features.  give it a go.,using free app version far run really like bit fun great feature give go,POSITIVE,using free app version far run really like bit fun great feature give go,,admiration,"Fitbit app used to be excellent. it is in decline unless you pay their monthly subscription! i paid £400 for a piece of tech and can only use its full potential if i keep paying! you can shove it fitbit, no doubt you are making fortunes using all the data you have on us too! i used to love my fitbit and have been a loyal customer for over a decade. the app was always great, simple to use, easy to read, good to see how you were doing over time. recently the app changed but the underlying sections remained usable, now the sleep app has been “updated” it is unusable. we comment but fitbit are ignoring us, time to look at other offerings. Sleep tracking is excellent, easy to use with a simple to learn ui. battery life is brilliant, last several days! superb fitness trackers with a very competitive prices. charge 5 worked perfectly and now i am on charge 6, which is just as good with a minor improvements, all adds up to very smooth user experience. great app for cyclists! it's my every day app for recording my sports activities. the segments feature is super addictive. no problem to pay 59 usd per year for it. keep up the good job by continuously adding features! great product and social experience with a positive effect. Each email takes 3-5 working days to get a response, and in my case the support agent took two of those emails to ask the same question twice (adding 10 days to the resolution) it took weeks to resolve a basic problem. a few months back i started tracking my walks. i do 2 miles a day minimum, and just being able to see all the data set me on my journey to lose weight and get fitter. i now use strava, and garmin app together. very good app. i can build my cycling routes easily and also share them with my fellow-cyclists. strava can connect with multiple cycling computers even those that are sold on aliexpress. which makes it easier to follow the routes i build in the strava app. i have been using strava for nearly 3 years. it's great an compatible with my apple watch. i have rated it 4 stars because the have removed feature, making them ""summit"" (premium) features. i use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great. excellent performance but the app hcrashes too much no, put a fix on it. only using the free app version so far for my runs and i really like it.  give it a go. Great website for tracking fitness activities. they could do with more premium features for runners. the site seems very geared towards cyclists. it's a great app, with information that can help people through any type of fitness journey. i appreciate the notifications throughout the day to log my meals. it's super easy to look up the foods i have either by the search bar or barcode. i'd like to see more nutrients/minerals in the nutrient breakdown tab. also less ads would be nice. App has helped me lose weight, eat better, exercise more, reach my goals and stay on track/maintain. great database for tracking food at meals, integration of data to/from other health apps and devices, nice goal setting/tracking features. Great app to track your calories and workouts! searching for food, it is a very thorough and complete database and very easy to find what you need for quick logins. The ability to make and save recipes is a great asset to the app! i've had for 3 years and it's been of invaluable help with my bulking and cutting bodybuilding cycles. brilliant bar code facility. would love if it was possible to duplicate items for multiple meals and days but other than that very user friendly. i’ve used this as a valuable tool to track my calories for the past 8 years. i like that u can put exercises in too. it helps to keep track of the days i exercise, all in one app. i'm amazed by how many foods are in the data bank. if the food i want is not there, i can usually find one similar. the posted columns are very useful and helpful. i especially like the recipes. It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what i'm eating. shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of premium for a pensioner is a little steep. Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight excellent app. taught me well about macro nutrition facts. it’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the upc - only accessible via the paid app. that was a greedy move. This app has helped me on my way of losing 38 pounds in about 3 months! tracking my food and nutritional values has led me to lose 95 lbs. i feel great, too! used for years!! great for calorie counting and keeping track of my nutrition values. Great app easy to use and excellent for daily use. so far the app has helped me lose 18 ibsbrilliant  it is easy to log your foods. has info on many foods and restaurants. great tool. helps me keep track of meals well. excellent as always the best app to use good app. easy to use  used this for years. fantastic my trainer arman at 24 our fitness set this app up for me so that i could track my progress. i also like the articles on recipes and nutritional information, and sometimes i try to make the dishes. the ability to find specific foods from stores and restaurants makes it easy to do your daily check in. another great feature is the bar code reader, meaning less typing. Great app, keeps me honest! really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. beautiful product with many options to assess your meals. i started using the app after a heart attack. i use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. it's great. The app helps me track my macros, so i can keep my protein and fat high and carbs low. functionality is great and relatively user friendly. the database often has any food i need. i've kept the extra weight off for 5 years now.  myfitnesspal is amazing! it has been a huge help in my weight loss journey. the food database is huge, and the barcode scanner makes logging meals super easy. it tracks my progress and syncs with my other fitness apps. highly recommend for anyone looking to get healthier!"

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
rubbish.  barely records half my activities.,rubbish barely record half activity,NEGATIVE,,rubbish barely record half activity,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"
just don't do it!!!  terrible company.,terrible company,NEGATIVE,,terrible company,disapproval,
strava used to awesome. now they want money and their gps works like crap now,strava used awesome want money gps work like crap,NEGATIVE,,strava used awesome want money gps work like crap,admiration,"Fitbit app used to be excellent. it is in decline unless you pay their monthly subscription! i paid £400 for a piece of tech and can only use its full potential if i keep paying! you can shove it fitbit, no doubt you are making fortunes using all the data you have on us too! i used to love my fitbit and have been a loyal customer for over a decade. the app was always great, simple to use, easy to read, good to see how you were doing over time. recently the app changed but the underlying sections remained usable, now the sleep app has been “updated” it is unusable. we comment but fitbit are ignoring us, time to look at other offerings. Sleep tracking is excellent, easy to use with a simple to learn ui. battery life is brilliant, last several days! superb fitness trackers with a very competitive prices. charge 5 worked perfectly and now i am on charge 6, which is just as good with a minor improvements, all adds up to very smooth user experience. great app for cyclists! it's my every day app for recording my sports activities. the segments feature is super addictive. no problem to pay 59 usd per year for it. keep up the good job by continuously adding features! great product and social experience with a positive effect. Each email takes 3-5 working days to get a response, and in my case the support agent took two of those emails to ask the same question twice (adding 10 days to the resolution) it took weeks to resolve a basic problem. a few months back i started tracking my walks. i do 2 miles a day minimum, and just being able to see all the data set me on my journey to lose weight and get fitter. i now use strava, and garmin app together. very good app. i can build my cycling routes easily and also share them with my fellow-cyclists. strava can connect with multiple cycling computers even those that are sold on aliexpress. which makes it easier to follow the routes i build in the strava app. i have been using strava for nearly 3 years. it's great an compatible with my apple watch. i have rated it 4 stars because the have removed feature, making them ""summit"" (premium) features. i use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great. excellent performance but the app hcrashes too much no, put a fix on it. only using the free app version so far for my runs and i really like it.  give it a go. Great website for tracking fitness activities. they could do with more premium features for runners. the site seems very geared towards cyclists. it's a great app, with information that can help people through any type of fitness journey. i appreciate the notifications throughout the day to log my meals. it's super easy to look up the foods i have either by the search bar or barcode. i'd like to see more nutrients/minerals in the nutrient breakdown tab. also less ads would be nice. App has helped me lose weight, eat better, exercise more, reach my goals and stay on track/maintain. great database for tracking food at meals, integration of data to/from other health apps and devices, nice goal setting/tracking features. Great app to track your calories and workouts! searching for food, it is a very thorough and complete database and very easy to find what you need for quick logins. The ability to make and save recipes is a great asset to the app! i've had for 3 years and it's been of invaluable help with my bulking and cutting bodybuilding cycles. brilliant bar code facility. would love if it was possible to duplicate items for multiple meals and days but other than that very user friendly. i’ve used this as a valuable tool to track my calories for the past 8 years. i like that u can put exercises in too. it helps to keep track of the days i exercise, all in one app. i'm amazed by how many foods are in the data bank. if the food i want is not there, i can usually find one similar. the posted columns are very useful and helpful. i especially like the recipes. It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what i'm eating. shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of premium for a pensioner is a little steep. Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight excellent app. taught me well about macro nutrition facts. it’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the upc - only accessible via the paid app. that was a greedy move. This app has helped me on my way of losing 38 pounds in about 3 months! tracking my food and nutritional values has led me to lose 95 lbs. i feel great, too! used for years!! great for calorie counting and keeping track of my nutrition values. Great app easy to use and excellent for daily use. so far the app has helped me lose 18 ibsbrilliant  it is easy to log your foods. has info on many foods and restaurants. great tool. helps me keep track of meals well. excellent as always the best app to use good app. easy to use  used this for years. fantastic my trainer arman at 24 our fitness set this app up for me so that i could track my progress. i also like the articles on recipes and nutritional information, and sometimes i try to make the dishes. the ability to find specific foods from stores and restaurants makes it easy to do your daily check in. another great feature is the bar code reader, meaning less typing. Great app, keeps me honest! really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. beautiful product with many options to assess your meals. i started using the app after a heart attack. i use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. it's great. The app helps me track my macros, so i can keep my protein and fat high and carbs low. functionality is great and relatively user friendly. the database often has any food i need. i've kept the extra weight off for 5 years now.  myfitnesspal is amazing! it has been a huge help in my weight loss journey. the food database is huge, and the barcode scanner makes logging meals super easy. it tracks my progress and syncs with my other fitness apps. highly recommend for anyone looking to get healthier!"

The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

"excellent experience, accurate data, free account with already several features.",excellent experience accurate data free account already several feature,POSITIVE,excellent experience accurate data free account already several feature,,admiration,"Fitbit app used to be excellent. it is in decline unless you pay their monthly subscription! i paid £400 for a piece of tech and can only use its full potential if i keep paying! you can shove it fitbit, no doubt you are making fortunes using all the data you have on us too! i used to love my fitbit and have been a loyal customer for over a decade. the app was always great, simple to use, easy to read, good to see how you were doing over time. recently the app changed but the underlying sections remained usable, now the sleep app has been “updated” it is unusable. we comment but fitbit are ignoring us, time to look at other offerings. Sleep tracking is excellent, easy to use with a simple to learn ui. battery life is brilliant, last several days! superb fitness trackers with a very competitive prices. charge 5 worked perfectly and now i am on charge 6, which is just as good with a minor improvements, all adds up to very smooth user experience. great app for cyclists! it's my every day app for recording my sports activities. the segments feature is super addictive. no problem to pay 59 usd per year for it. keep up the good job by continuously adding features! great product and social experience with a positive effect. Each email takes 3-5 working days to get a response, and in my case the support agent took two of those emails to ask the same question twice (adding 10 days to the resolution) it took weeks to resolve a basic problem. a few months back i started tracking my walks. i do 2 miles a day minimum, and just being able to see all the data set me on my journey to lose weight and get fitter. i now use strava, and garmin app together. very good app. i can build my cycling routes easily and also share them with my fellow-cyclists. strava can connect with multiple cycling computers even those that are sold on aliexpress. which makes it easier to follow the routes i build in the strava app. i have been using strava for nearly 3 years. it's great an compatible with my apple watch. i have rated it 4 stars because the have removed feature, making them ""summit"" (premium) features. i use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great. excellent performance but the app hcrashes too much no, put a fix on it. only using the free app version so far for my runs and i really like it.  give it a go. Great website for tracking fitness activities. they could do with more premium features for runners. the site seems very geared towards cyclists. it's a great app, with information that can help people through any type of fitness journey. i appreciate the notifications throughout the day to log my meals. it's super easy to look up the foods i have either by the search bar or barcode. i'd like to see more nutrients/minerals in the nutrient breakdown tab. also less ads would be nice. App has helped me lose weight, eat better, exercise more, reach my goals and stay on track/maintain. great database for tracking food at meals, integration of data to/from other health apps and devices, nice goal setting/tracking features. Great app to track your calories and workouts! searching for food, it is a very thorough and complete database and very easy to find what you need for quick logins. The ability to make and save recipes is a great asset to the app! i've had for 3 years and it's been of invaluable help with my bulking and cutting bodybuilding cycles. brilliant bar code facility. would love if it was possible to duplicate items for multiple meals and days but other than that very user friendly. i’ve used this as a valuable tool to track my calories for the past 8 years. i like that u can put exercises in too. it helps to keep track of the days i exercise, all in one app. i'm amazed by how many foods are in the data bank. if the food i want is not there, i can usually find one similar. the posted columns are very useful and helpful. i especially like the recipes. It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what i'm eating. shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of premium for a pensioner is a little steep. Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight excellent app. taught me well about macro nutrition facts. it’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the upc - only accessible via the paid app. that was a greedy move. This app has helped me on my way of losing 38 pounds in about 3 months! tracking my food and nutritional values has led me to lose 95 lbs. i feel great, too! used for years!! great for calorie counting and keeping track of my nutrition values. Great app easy to use and excellent for daily use. so far the app has helped me lose 18 ibsbrilliant  it is easy to log your foods. has info on many foods and restaurants. great tool. helps me keep track of meals well. excellent as always the best app to use good app. easy to use  used this for years. fantastic my trainer arman at 24 our fitness set this app up for me so that i could track my progress. i also like the articles on recipes and nutritional information, and sometimes i try to make the dishes. the ability to find specific foods from stores and restaurants makes it easy to do your daily check in. another great feature is the bar code reader, meaning less typing. Great app, keeps me honest! really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. beautiful product with many options to assess your meals. i started using the app after a heart attack. i use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. it's great. The app helps me track my macros, so i can keep my protein and fat high and carbs low. functionality is great and relatively user friendly. the database often has any food i need. i've kept the extra weight off for 5 years now.  myfitnesspal is amazing! it has been a huge help in my weight loss journey. the food database is huge, and the barcode scanner makes logging meals super easy. it tracks my progress and syncs with my other fitness apps. highly recommend for anyone looking to get healthier!"

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro.

Please submit your best shots of New York for next week. Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of snapshots. i love fitbit and am obsessed with my watch. over the past 4 years my fitbit has stopped working twice and both times they ask me to send it back and have sent me a brand new one! not many companies would do that so i think it's great. i generally find it so great for tracking all my exercise too and there’s so much you can do on the app. i would never move to any other watch and always recommend them. my fitbit stopped working, customer service was useless and just offered me discount on a new purchase. when i asked how to make a complaint they went from replying promptly to completely ignoring me. i only wish i'd read the reviews years ago as i certainly would've avoided this company. i know they had a premium service that could go in depth but now all basic functions are behind that paywall. my advice: use a different app. used to be a great app, now they have changed it so you need to pay for the most basic of functions. The app runs well most of the time but sometimes doesn't work as well. other than the negative, a good app. they need to sort the money business out. sort it out strava! good at dealing with specific enquiries on rides, but there are some long highlighted general issues that have been raised many times by different people. happy with the overall use of the site via a pc, not so much so on the app. going the paid route opens up so much more and this is both insightful and in my case, helps motivate me. i find the menu easy to navigate, and the info on calories and nutrients is very helpful. search function in “add a food” has some incorrect calorie counts. system automatically adds my exercise calories to my daily total. i can’t opt out of that without upgrading to premium. i have been using myfitnesspal for many years and i had bariatric surgery 3 years ago and this is a very handy tool to use to track. what i used to like i was able to scan my food for free. however now i write my food in because for scanning it isn't free anymore. i still like tracking calories even though i write them in.  myfitnesspal has become my de facto way of keeping track of calories. its accurate, extremely easy to use and would be difficult to do without. this app has a very extensive data base so makes it easy to track my daily food intake. My fitness pal is a brilliant app for managing everything linked to a healthy lifestyle. it is easy to use and if you subscribe to the premium service then you get fantastic value for money. i personally use the basic service for free as my only requirement is the food diary. you will not be disappointed using my fitness pal, and i will guarantee that. i've been using this app to track workouts and meals for years. i trust its data more than any other app i've used. it’s app is easy to use and they everything imaginable listed! i still use the free app and am tempted to try the updated version. Myfitnesspal is right on. always room for improvement, especially for people who don't eat processed food. having to continually put in ingredients i choose to eat is somewhat challenging, especially since i often substitute the alternative ingredients in recipes. i use mFP to track my weight and calories, and it has helped me achieve my fitness goals through the years. fitness pal is easy to use, to check my daily nutrients (calories, carbs, fiber, etc). most of my meal choices are already included in the data. The app is easy to use and perfect for managing my fitness goals. easy ti use and upload myfeedback which was welcomed by the company i bought from. i've been using it consistently for past 2 months and i'm literally seeing the results on weekly basis. i have been using this app daily for over a year. the workout feature is hit and miss, but basically it works well. it’s easy to communicate with other bikers in the community and share experiences. This app is simple to use and really helps me stay on track. wo helpful and easy. it does what i need it to do when i use it right. it has what i want. i’m a long time user and credit my fitness pal with providing both information and the discipline needed to first lose weight and then maintain. i have many friends who complain about not being able to lose weight but have no clue about how many calories, carbs, fats etc they consume. additionally they don’t understand how few calories are actually needed by the human body per day or the amount of exercise needed per day. i was recently diagnosed with gallbladder and liver issues. myfitnesspal has made it much easier to visualize if i’m achieving my macro and nutrient goals for those conditions. with their premium features, it has been worth it! i like that i can scan food to get the nutrition info. i started the south beach diet at my dr’s recommendation and found it hard to find information within the app to follow it. good to count calories and keep trsvk. expensive to go premium."

"the app and website are both riddled with bugs, despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. customer support is just very very poor. despite sending them emails with snapshots of issues and explaining the problems in detail in the email, they seem to ignore anything but the subject line of the email and reply with a typical template response which is absolutely useless. recently strava tried to be 'smart' and messed up with privacy settings so that now you need to set them to 'everyone' to get counted towards monthly challenges. it is absolutely ridiculous as to why would everyone want to reveal their whereabouts/ activity routes to everyone on strava?!?!?!?! previously the privacy settings, even when sent to 'followers', would allow you to be counted towards monthly activity challenges.poor, poor, poor.",app website riddled bug despite notification switched club still keep getting customer service could help resolve customer support poor despite sending email snapshot issue explaining problem detail email seem ignore anything subject line email reply typical template response absolutely useless recently strava tried messed privacy setting need set get counted towards monthly challenge absolutely ridiculous would everyone want reveal activity route everyone strava previously privacy setting even sent would allow counted towards monthly activity poor poor,NEGATIVE,,app website riddled bug despite notification switched club still keep getting customer service could help resolve customer support poor despite sending email snapshot issue explaining problem detail email seem ignore anything subject line email reply typical template response absolutely useless recently strava tried messed privacy setting need set get counted towards monthly challenge absolutely ridiculous would everyone want reveal activity route everyone strava previously privacy setting even sent would allow counted towards monthly activity poor poor,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
completely useless customer service. i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan,completely useless customer service contacted multiple time multiple month try sort account initially reply template response beyond useless ignore message come great product customer service beyond terrible would anyone ever sign paid plan,NEGATIVE,,completely useless customer service contacted multiple time multiple month try sort account initially reply template response beyond useless ignore message come great product customer service beyond terrible would anyone ever sign paid plan,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

great website for tracking fitness activities. they could do with more premium features for runners. the site seems very geared towards cyclists.,great website tracking fitness activity could premium feature runner site seems geared towards cyclist,POSITIVE,great website tracking fitness activity could premium feature runner site seems geared towards cyclist,,admiration,"Fitbit app used to be excellent. it is in decline unless you pay their monthly subscription! i paid £400 for a piece of tech and can only use its full potential if i keep paying! you can shove it fitbit, no doubt you are making fortunes using all the data you have on us too! i used to love my fitbit and have been a loyal customer for over a decade. the app was always great, simple to use, easy to read, good to see how you were doing over time. recently the app changed but the underlying sections remained usable, now the sleep app has been “updated” it is unusable. we comment but fitbit are ignoring us, time to look at other offerings. Sleep tracking is excellent, easy to use with a simple to learn ui. battery life is brilliant, last several days! superb fitness trackers with a very competitive prices. charge 5 worked perfectly and now i am on charge 6, which is just as good with a minor improvements, all adds up to very smooth user experience. great app for cyclists! it's my every day app for recording my sports activities. the segments feature is super addictive. no problem to pay 59 usd per year for it. keep up the good job by continuously adding features! great product and social experience with a positive effect. Each email takes 3-5 working days to get a response, and in my case the support agent took two of those emails to ask the same question twice (adding 10 days to the resolution) it took weeks to resolve a basic problem. a few months back i started tracking my walks. i do 2 miles a day minimum, and just being able to see all the data set me on my journey to lose weight and get fitter. i now use strava, and garmin app together. very good app. i can build my cycling routes easily and also share them with my fellow-cyclists. strava can connect with multiple cycling computers even those that are sold on aliexpress. which makes it easier to follow the routes i build in the strava app. i have been using strava for nearly 3 years. it's great an compatible with my apple watch. i have rated it 4 stars because the have removed feature, making them ""summit"" (premium) features. i use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great. excellent performance but the app hcrashes too much no, put a fix on it. only using the free app version so far for my runs and i really like it.  give it a go. Great website for tracking fitness activities. they could do with more premium features for runners. the site seems very geared towards cyclists. it's a great app, with information that can help people through any type of fitness journey. i appreciate the notifications throughout the day to log my meals. it's super easy to look up the foods i have either by the search bar or barcode. i'd like to see more nutrients/minerals in the nutrient breakdown tab. also less ads would be nice. App has helped me lose weight, eat better, exercise more, reach my goals and stay on track/maintain. great database for tracking food at meals, integration of data to/from other health apps and devices, nice goal setting/tracking features. Great app to track your calories and workouts! searching for food, it is a very thorough and complete database and very easy to find what you need for quick logins. The ability to make and save recipes is a great asset to the app! i've had for 3 years and it's been of invaluable help with my bulking and cutting bodybuilding cycles. brilliant bar code facility. would love if it was possible to duplicate items for multiple meals and days but other than that very user friendly. i’ve used this as a valuable tool to track my calories for the past 8 years. i like that u can put exercises in too. it helps to keep track of the days i exercise, all in one app. i'm amazed by how many foods are in the data bank. if the food i want is not there, i can usually find one similar. the posted columns are very useful and helpful. i especially like the recipes. It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what i'm eating. shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of premium for a pensioner is a little steep. Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight excellent app. taught me well about macro nutrition facts. it’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the upc - only accessible via the paid app. that was a greedy move. This app has helped me on my way of losing 38 pounds in about 3 months! tracking my food and nutritional values has led me to lose 95 lbs. i feel great, too! used for years!! great for calorie counting and keeping track of my nutrition values. Great app easy to use and excellent for daily use. so far the app has helped me lose 18 ibsbrilliant  it is easy to log your foods. has info on many foods and restaurants. great tool. helps me keep track of meals well. excellent as always the best app to use good app. easy to use  used this for years. fantastic my trainer arman at 24 our fitness set this app up for me so that i could track my progress. i also like the articles on recipes and nutritional information, and sometimes i try to make the dishes. the ability to find specific foods from stores and restaurants makes it easy to do your daily check in. another great feature is the bar code reader, meaning less typing. Great app, keeps me honest! really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. beautiful product with many options to assess your meals. i started using the app after a heart attack. i use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. it's great. The app helps me track my macros, so i can keep my protein and fat high and carbs low. functionality is great and relatively user friendly. the database often has any food i need. i've kept the extra weight off for 5 years now.  myfitnesspal is amazing! it has been a huge help in my weight loss journey. the food database is huge, and the barcode scanner makes logging meals super easy. it tracks my progress and syncs with my other fitness apps. highly recommend for anyone looking to get healthier!"
"paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! you lost me to the new viral scale on tik tok that comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros which you also hide away unless you pay an arm and a leg. get outta here my fitness pal, do better. ",paying arm leg scan thing absolutely ridiculous lost new viral scale tik tok come free app scan log intake well macro also hide away unless pay arm leg get outta fitness pal better,NEGATIVE,,paying arm leg scan thing absolutely ridiculous lost new viral scale tik tok come free app scan log intake well macro also hide away unless pay arm leg get outta fitness pal better,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts.

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."
"i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden, even cooking; otherwise there is a mismatch between predicted and actual weight. annoyingly of late, the app is now frequently asking me to log back in, which looses it a star. why has this been changed?",used without break obviously finding useful nutrition balance tracking calorie endurance cyclist help match intake exercise respect one need take account secondary activity walking house garden even cooking otherwise mismatch predicted actual weight annoyingly late app frequently asking log back loos star changed,NEGATIVE,,used without break obviously finding useful nutrition balance tracking calorie endurance cyclist help match intake exercise respect one need take account secondary activity walking house garden even cooking otherwise mismatch predicted actual weight annoyingly late app frequently asking log back loos star changed,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

Sleep tracking is excellent, easy to use with a simple to learn ui. battery life is brilliant, last several days! superb fitness trackers with a very competitive prices. charge 5 worked perfectly and now i am on charge 6, which is just as good with a minor improvements, all adds up to very smooth user experience. great app for cyclists! it's my every day app for recording my sports activities. the segments feature is super addictive. no problem to pay 59 usd per year for it. keep up the good job by continuously adding features! great product and social experience with a positive effect. Each email takes 3-5 working days to get a response, and in my case the support agent took two of those emails to ask the same question twice (adding 10 days to the resolution) it took weeks to resolve a basic problem. a few months back i started tracking my walks. i do 2 miles a day minimum, and just being able to see all the data set me on my journey to lose weight and get fitter. i now use strava, and garmin app together. very good app. i can build my cycling routes easily and also share them with my fellow-cyclists. strava can connect with multiple cycling computers even those that are sold on aliexpress. which makes it easier to follow the routes i build in the strava app. i have been using strava for nearly 3 years. it's great an compatible with my apple watch. i have rated it 4 stars because the have removed feature, making them ""summit"" (premium) features. i use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great. excellent performance but the app hcrashes too much no, put a fix on it. only using the free app version so far for my runs and i really like it.  give it a go. Great website for tracking fitness activities. they could do with more premium features for runners. the site seems very geared towards cyclists. it's a great app, with information that can help people through any type of fitness journey. i appreciate the notifications throughout the day to log my meals. it's super easy to look up the foods i have either by the search bar or barcode. i'd like to see more nutrients/minerals in the nutrient breakdown tab. also less ads would be nice. App has helped me lose weight, eat better, exercise more, reach my goals and stay on track/maintain. great database for tracking food at meals, integration of data to/from other health apps and devices, nice goal setting/tracking features. Great app to track your calories and workouts! searching for food, it is a very thorough and complete database and very easy to find what you need for quick logins. The ability to make and save recipes is a great asset to the app! i've had for 3 years and it's been of invaluable help with my bulking and cutting bodybuilding cycles. brilliant bar code facility. would love if it was possible to duplicate items for multiple meals and days but other than that very user friendly. i’ve used this as a valuable tool to track my calories for the past 8 years. i like that u can put exercises in too. it helps to keep track of the days i exercise, all in one app. i'm amazed by how many foods are in the data bank. if the food i want is not there, i can usually find one similar. the posted columns are very useful and helpful. i especially like the recipes. It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what i'm eating. shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of premium for a pensioner is a little steep. Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight excellent app. taught me well about macro nutrition facts. it’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the upc - only accessible via the paid app. that was a greedy move. This app has helped me on my way of losing 38 pounds in about 3 months! tracking my food and nutritional values has led me to lose 95 lbs. i feel great, too! used for years!! great for calorie counting and keeping track of my nutrition values. Great app easy to use and excellent for daily use. so far the app has helped me lose 18 ibsbrilliant  it is easy to log your foods. has info on many foods and restaurants. great tool. helps me keep track of meals well. excellent as always the best app to use good app. easy to use  used this for years. fantastic my trainer arman at 24 our fitness set this app up for me so that i could track my progress. i also like the articles on recipes and nutritional information, and sometimes i try to make the dishes. the ability to find specific foods from stores and restaurants makes it easy to do your daily check in. another great feature is the bar code reader, meaning less typing. Great app, keeps me honest! really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. beautiful product with many options to assess your meals. i started using the app after a heart attack. i use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. it's great. The app helps me track my macros, so i can keep my protein and fat high and carbs low. functionality is great and relatively user friendly. the database often has any food i need. i've kept the extra weight off for 5 years now.  myfitnesspal is amazing! it has been a huge help in my weight loss journey. the food database is huge, and the barcode scanner makes logging meals super easy. it tracks my progress and syncs with my other fitness apps. highly recommend for anyone looking to get healthier!"

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

The app runs well most of the time but sometimes doesn't work as well. other than the negative, a good app. they need to sort the money business out. sort it out strava! good at dealing with specific enquiries on rides, but there are some long highlighted general issues that have been raised many times by different people. happy with the overall use of the site via a pc, not so much so on the app. going the paid route opens up so much more and this is both insightful and in my case, helps motivate me. i find the menu easy to navigate, and the info on calories and nutrients is very helpful. search function in “add a food” has some incorrect calorie counts. system automatically adds my exercise calories to my daily total. i can’t opt out of that without upgrading to premium. i have been using myfitnesspal for many years and i had bariatric surgery 3 years ago and this is a very handy tool to use to track. what i used to like i was able to scan my food for free. however now i write my food in because for scanning it isn't free anymore. i still like tracking calories even though i write them in.  myfitnesspal has become my de facto way of keeping track of calories. its accurate, extremely easy to use and would be difficult to do without. this app has a very extensive data base so makes it easy to track my daily food intake. My fitness pal is a brilliant app for managing everything linked to a healthy lifestyle. it is easy to use and if you subscribe to the premium service then you get fantastic value for money. i personally use the basic service for free as my only requirement is the food diary. you will not be disappointed using my fitness pal, and i will guarantee that. i've been using this app to track workouts and meals for years. i trust its data more than any other app i've used. it’s app is easy to use and they everything imaginable listed! i still use the free app and am tempted to try the updated version. Myfitnesspal is right on. always room for improvement, especially for people who don't eat processed food. having to continually put in ingredients i choose to eat is somewhat challenging, especially since i often substitute the alternative ingredients in recipes. i use mFP to track my weight and calories, and it has helped me achieve my fitness goals through the years. fitness pal is easy to use, to check my daily nutrients (calories, carbs, fiber, etc). most of my meal choices are already included in the data. The app is easy to use and perfect for managing my fitness goals. easy ti use and upload myfeedback which was welcomed by the company i bought from. i've been using it consistently for past 2 months and i'm literally seeing the results on weekly basis. i have been using this app daily for over a year. the workout feature is hit and miss, but basically it works well. it’s easy to communicate with other bikers in the community and share experiences. This app is simple to use and really helps me stay on track. wo helpful and easy. it does what i need it to do when i use it right. it has what i want. i’m a long time user and credit my fitness pal with providing both information and the discipline needed to first lose weight and then maintain. i have many friends who complain about not being able to lose weight but have no clue about how many calories, carbs, fats etc they consume. additionally they don’t understand how few calories are actually needed by the human body per day or the amount of exercise needed per day. i was recently diagnosed with gallbladder and liver issues. myfitnesspal has made it much easier to visualize if i’m achieving my macro and nutrient goals for those conditions. with their premium features, it has been worth it! i like that i can scan food to get the nutrition info. i started the south beach diet at my dr’s recommendation and found it hard to find information within the app to follow it. good to count calories and keep trsvk. expensive to go premium."
app works great.  lots of matches in the database.  accessing premium features such as nutrients and macros is very helpful,app work great lot match database accessing premium feature nutrient macro helpful,POSITIVE,app work great lot match database accessing premium feature nutrient macro helpful,,admiration,"Fitbit app used to be excellent. it is in decline unless you pay their monthly subscription! i paid £400 for a piece of tech and can only use its full potential if i keep paying! you can shove it fitbit, no doubt you are making fortunes using all the data you have on us too! i used to love my fitbit and have been a loyal customer for over a decade. the app was always great, simple to use, easy to read, good to see how you were doing over time. recently the app changed but the underlying sections remained usable, now the sleep app has been “updated” it is unusable. we comment but fitbit are ignoring us, time to look at other offerings. Sleep tracking is excellent, easy to use with a simple to learn ui. battery life is brilliant, last several days! superb fitness trackers with a very competitive prices. charge 5 worked perfectly and now i am on charge 6, which is just as good with a minor improvements, all adds up to very smooth user experience. great app for cyclists! it's my every day app for recording my sports activities. the segments feature is super addictive. no problem to pay 59 usd per year for it. keep up the good job by continuously adding features! great product and social experience with a positive effect. Each email takes 3-5 working days to get a response, and in my case the support agent took two of those emails to ask the same question twice (adding 10 days to the resolution) it took weeks to resolve a basic problem. a few months back i started tracking my walks. i do 2 miles a day minimum, and just being able to see all the data set me on my journey to lose weight and get fitter. i now use strava, and garmin app together. very good app. i can build my cycling routes easily and also share them with my fellow-cyclists. strava can connect with multiple cycling computers even those that are sold on aliexpress. which makes it easier to follow the routes i build in the strava app. i have been using strava for nearly 3 years. it's great an compatible with my apple watch. i have rated it 4 stars because the have removed feature, making them ""summit"" (premium) features. i use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great. excellent performance but the app hcrashes too much no, put a fix on it. only using the free app version so far for my runs and i really like it.  give it a go. Great website for tracking fitness activities. they could do with more premium features for runners. the site seems very geared towards cyclists. it's a great app, with information that can help people through any type of fitness journey. i appreciate the notifications throughout the day to log my meals. it's super easy to look up the foods i have either by the search bar or barcode. i'd like to see more nutrients/minerals in the nutrient breakdown tab. also less ads would be nice. App has helped me lose weight, eat better, exercise more, reach my goals and stay on track/maintain. great database for tracking food at meals, integration of data to/from other health apps and devices, nice goal setting/tracking features. Great app to track your calories and workouts! searching for food, it is a very thorough and complete database and very easy to find what you need for quick logins. The ability to make and save recipes is a great asset to the app! i've had for 3 years and it's been of invaluable help with my bulking and cutting bodybuilding cycles. brilliant bar code facility. would love if it was possible to duplicate items for multiple meals and days but other than that very user friendly. i’ve used this as a valuable tool to track my calories for the past 8 years. i like that u can put exercises in too. it helps to keep track of the days i exercise, all in one app. i'm amazed by how many foods are in the data bank. if the food i want is not there, i can usually find one similar. the posted columns are very useful and helpful. i especially like the recipes. It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what i'm eating. shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of premium for a pensioner is a little steep. Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight excellent app. taught me well about macro nutrition facts. it’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the upc - only accessible via the paid app. that was a greedy move. This app has helped me on my way of losing 38 pounds in about 3 months! tracking my food and nutritional values has led me to lose 95 lbs. i feel great, too! used for years!! great for calorie counting and keeping track of my nutrition values. Great app easy to use and excellent for daily use. so far the app has helped me lose 18 ibsbrilliant  it is easy to log your foods. has info on many foods and restaurants. great tool. helps me keep track of meals well. excellent as always the best app to use good app. easy to use  used this for years. fantastic my trainer arman at 24 our fitness set this app up for me so that i could track my progress. i also like the articles on recipes and nutritional information, and sometimes i try to make the dishes. the ability to find specific foods from stores and restaurants makes it easy to do your daily check in. another great feature is the bar code reader, meaning less typing. Great app, keeps me honest! really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. beautiful product with many options to assess your meals. i started using the app after a heart attack. i use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. it's great. The app helps me track my macros, so i can keep my protein and fat high and carbs low. functionality is great and relatively user friendly. the database often has any food i need. i've kept the extra weight off for 5 years now.  myfitnesspal is amazing! it has been a huge help in my weight loss journey. the food database is huge, and the barcode scanner makes logging meals super easy. it tracks my progress and syncs with my other fitness apps. highly recommend for anyone looking to get healthier!"

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

Please submit your best shots of New York for next week. Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of snapshots. i love fitbit and am obsessed with my watch. over the past 4 years my fitbit has stopped working twice and both times they ask me to send it back and have sent me a brand new one! not many companies would do that so i think it's great. i generally find it so great for tracking all my exercise too and there’s so much you can do on the app. i would never move to any other watch and always recommend them. my fitbit stopped working, customer service was useless and just offered me discount on a new purchase. when i asked how to make a complaint they went from replying promptly to completely ignoring me. i only wish i'd read the reviews years ago as i certainly would've avoided this company. i know they had a premium service that could go in depth but now all basic functions are behind that paywall. my advice: use a different app. used to be a great app, now they have changed it so you need to pay for the most basic of functions. The app runs well most of the time but sometimes doesn't work as well. other than the negative, a good app. they need to sort the money business out. sort it out strava! good at dealing with specific enquiries on rides, but there are some long highlighted general issues that have been raised many times by different people. happy with the overall use of the site via a pc, not so much so on the app. going the paid route opens up so much more and this is both insightful and in my case, helps motivate me. i find the menu easy to navigate, and the info on calories and nutrients is very helpful. search function in “add a food” has some incorrect calorie counts. system automatically adds my exercise calories to my daily total. i can’t opt out of that without upgrading to premium. i have been using myfitnesspal for many years and i had bariatric surgery 3 years ago and this is a very handy tool to use to track. what i used to like i was able to scan my food for free. however now i write my food in because for scanning it isn't free anymore. i still like tracking calories even though i write them in.  myfitnesspal has become my de facto way of keeping track of calories. its accurate, extremely easy to use and would be difficult to do without. this app has a very extensive data base so makes it easy to track my daily food intake. My fitness pal is a brilliant app for managing everything linked to a healthy lifestyle. it is easy to use and if you subscribe to the premium service then you get fantastic value for money. i personally use the basic service for free as my only requirement is the food diary. you will not be disappointed using my fitness pal, and i will guarantee that. i've been using this app to track workouts and meals for years. i trust its data more than any other app i've used. it’s app is easy to use and they everything imaginable listed! i still use the free app and am tempted to try the updated version. Myfitnesspal is right on. always room for improvement, especially for people who don't eat processed food. having to continually put in ingredients i choose to eat is somewhat challenging, especially since i often substitute the alternative ingredients in recipes. i use mFP to track my weight and calories, and it has helped me achieve my fitness goals through the years. fitness pal is easy to use, to check my daily nutrients (calories, carbs, fiber, etc). most of my meal choices are already included in the data. The app is easy to use and perfect for managing my fitness goals. easy ti use and upload myfeedback which was welcomed by the company i bought from. i've been using it consistently for past 2 months and i'm literally seeing the results on weekly basis. i have been using this app daily for over a year. the workout feature is hit and miss, but basically it works well. it’s easy to communicate with other bikers in the community and share experiences. This app is simple to use and really helps me stay on track. wo helpful and easy. it does what i need it to do when i use it right. it has what i want. i’m a long time user and credit my fitness pal with providing both information and the discipline needed to first lose weight and then maintain. i have many friends who complain about not being able to lose weight but have no clue about how many calories, carbs, fats etc they consume. additionally they don’t understand how few calories are actually needed by the human body per day or the amount of exercise needed per day. i was recently diagnosed with gallbladder and liver issues. myfitnesspal has made it much easier to visualize if i’m achieving my macro and nutrient goals for those conditions. with their premium features, it has been worth it! i like that i can scan food to get the nutrition info. i started the south beach diet at my dr’s recommendation and found it hard to find information within the app to follow it. good to count calories and keep trsvk. expensive to go premium."

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"
it's generally a good app to keep track of your calories. they took away the scanning of items in the free version and put that in the premium version. that move disappointed me. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$$$$$ hungry,generally good app keep track calorie took away scanning item free version put premium version move disappointed understand money make world go round move greed even made video good app got hungry,NEGATIVE,,generally good app keep track calorie took away scanning item free version put premium version move disappointed understand money make world go round move greed even made video good app got hungry,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

Please submit your best shots of New York for next week. Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of snapshots. i love fitbit and am obsessed with my watch. over the past 4 years my fitbit has stopped working twice and both times they ask me to send it back and have sent me a brand new one! not many companies would do that so i think it's great. i generally find it so great for tracking all my exercise too and there’s so much you can do on the app. i would never move to any other watch and always recommend them. my fitbit stopped working, customer service was useless and just offered me discount on a new purchase. when i asked how to make a complaint they went from replying promptly to completely ignoring me. i only wish i'd read the reviews years ago as i certainly would've avoided this company. i know they had a premium service that could go in depth but now all basic functions are behind that paywall. my advice: use a different app. used to be a great app, now they have changed it so you need to pay for the most basic of functions. The app runs well most of the time but sometimes doesn't work as well. other than the negative, a good app. they need to sort the money business out. sort it out strava! good at dealing with specific enquiries on rides, but there are some long highlighted general issues that have been raised many times by different people. happy with the overall use of the site via a pc, not so much so on the app. going the paid route opens up so much more and this is both insightful and in my case, helps motivate me. i find the menu easy to navigate, and the info on calories and nutrients is very helpful. search function in “add a food” has some incorrect calorie counts. system automatically adds my exercise calories to my daily total. i can’t opt out of that without upgrading to premium. i have been using myfitnesspal for many years and i had bariatric surgery 3 years ago and this is a very handy tool to use to track. what i used to like i was able to scan my food for free. however now i write my food in because for scanning it isn't free anymore. i still like tracking calories even though i write them in.  myfitnesspal has become my de facto way of keeping track of calories. its accurate, extremely easy to use and would be difficult to do without. this app has a very extensive data base so makes it easy to track my daily food intake. My fitness pal is a brilliant app for managing everything linked to a healthy lifestyle. it is easy to use and if you subscribe to the premium service then you get fantastic value for money. i personally use the basic service for free as my only requirement is the food diary. you will not be disappointed using my fitness pal, and i will guarantee that. i've been using this app to track workouts and meals for years. i trust its data more than any other app i've used. it’s app is easy to use and they everything imaginable listed! i still use the free app and am tempted to try the updated version. Myfitnesspal is right on. always room for improvement, especially for people who don't eat processed food. having to continually put in ingredients i choose to eat is somewhat challenging, especially since i often substitute the alternative ingredients in recipes. i use mFP to track my weight and calories, and it has helped me achieve my fitness goals through the years. fitness pal is easy to use, to check my daily nutrients (calories, carbs, fiber, etc). most of my meal choices are already included in the data. The app is easy to use and perfect for managing my fitness goals. easy ti use and upload myfeedback which was welcomed by the company i bought from. i've been using it consistently for past 2 months and i'm literally seeing the results on weekly basis. i have been using this app daily for over a year. the workout feature is hit and miss, but basically it works well. it’s easy to communicate with other bikers in the community and share experiences. This app is simple to use and really helps me stay on track. wo helpful and easy. it does what i need it to do when i use it right. it has what i want. i’m a long time user and credit my fitness pal with providing both information and the discipline needed to first lose weight and then maintain. i have many friends who complain about not being able to lose weight but have no clue about how many calories, carbs, fats etc they consume. additionally they don’t understand how few calories are actually needed by the human body per day or the amount of exercise needed per day. i was recently diagnosed with gallbladder and liver issues. myfitnesspal has made it much easier to visualize if i’m achieving my macro and nutrient goals for those conditions. with their premium features, it has been worth it! i like that i can scan food to get the nutrition info. i started the south beach diet at my dr’s recommendation and found it hard to find information within the app to follow it. good to count calories and keep trsvk. expensive to go premium."

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of snapshots. i love fitbit and am obsessed with my watch. over the past 4 years my fitbit has stopped working twice and both times they ask me to send it back and have sent me a brand new one! not many companies would do that so i think it's great. i generally find it so great for tracking all my exercise too and there’s so much you can do on the app. i would never move to any other watch and always recommend them. my fitbit stopped working, customer service was useless and just offered me discount on a new purchase. when i asked how to make a complaint they went from replying promptly to completely ignoring me. i only wish i'd read the reviews years ago as i certainly would've avoided this company. i know they had a premium service that could go in depth but now all basic functions are behind that paywall. my advice: use a different app. used to be a great app, now they have changed it so you need to pay for the most basic of functions. The app runs well most of the time but sometimes doesn't work as well. other than the negative, a good app. they need to sort the money business out. sort it out strava! good at dealing with specific enquiries on rides, but there are some long highlighted general issues that have been raised many times by different people. happy with the overall use of the site via a pc, not so much so on the app. going the paid route opens up so much more and this is both insightful and in my case, helps motivate me. i find the menu easy to navigate, and the info on calories and nutrients is very helpful. search function in “add a food” has some incorrect calorie counts. system automatically adds my exercise calories to my daily total. i can’t opt out of that without upgrading to premium. i have been using myfitnesspal for many years and i had bariatric surgery 3 years ago and this is a very handy tool to use to track. what i used to like i was able to scan my food for free. however now i write my food in because for scanning it isn't free anymore. i still like tracking calories even though i write them in.  myfitnesspal has become my de facto way of keeping track of calories. its accurate, extremely easy to use and would be difficult to do without. this app has a very extensive data base so makes it easy to track my daily food intake. My fitness pal is a brilliant app for managing everything linked to a healthy lifestyle. it is easy to use and if you subscribe to the premium service then you get fantastic value for money. i personally use the basic service for free as my only requirement is the food diary. you will not be disappointed using my fitness pal, and i will guarantee that. i've been using this app to track workouts and meals for years. i trust its data more than any other app i've used. it’s app is easy to use and they everything imaginable listed! i still use the free app and am tempted to try the updated version. Myfitnesspal is right on. always room for improvement, especially for people who don't eat processed food. having to continually put in ingredients i choose to eat is somewhat challenging, especially since i often substitute the alternative ingredients in recipes. i use mFP to track my weight and calories, and it has helped me achieve my fitness goals through the years. fitness pal is easy to use, to check my daily nutrients (calories, carbs, fiber, etc). most of my meal choices are already included in the data. The app is easy to use and perfect for managing my fitness goals. easy ti use and upload myfeedback which was welcomed by the company i bought from. i've been using it consistently for past 2 months and i'm literally seeing the results on weekly basis. i have been using this app daily for over a year. the workout feature is hit and miss, but basically it works well. it’s easy to communicate with other bikers in the community and share experiences. This app is simple to use and really helps me stay on track. wo helpful and easy. it does what i need it to do when i use it right. it has what i want. i’m a long time user and credit my fitness pal with providing both information and the discipline needed to first lose weight and then maintain. i have many friends who complain about not being able to lose weight but have no clue about how many calories, carbs, fats etc they consume. additionally they don’t understand how few calories are actually needed by the human body per day or the amount of exercise needed per day. i was recently diagnosed with gallbladder and liver issues. myfitnesspal has made it much easier to visualize if i’m achieving my macro and nutrient goals for those conditions. with their premium features, it has been worth it! i like that i can scan food to get the nutrition info. i started the south beach diet at my dr’s recommendation and found it hard to find information within the app to follow it. good to count calories and keep trsvk. expensive to go premium."

"april 25i sent you the letter below weeks ago, but you must not have received it since i received no acknowledgement. for what it is worth, i will allow the renewal to go through, but i expect to pay more for poor, sub-standard service.i would not recommend your app to anyone without reservations. your app is not friendly to seniors nor to people with limited manual dexterity.april 5, 2024a few months ago, you had your users fill out an online survey. i expect the rates will go up when i renew my subscription based upon the questions asked. what you did not ask was what i, as a user, valued. you did provide a list of pre-approved values but did not ask about anything not on the list.i use your mobile app to enter my meals and exercise, but it is not useful for me to do anything else. i primarily use your website on my desktop. the website is not user friendly.on the smart phone, i have found the app doesn’t always “remember” foods i have used in the past. when entering foods for meals, the “frequently paired foods” offers foods i haven’t eaten in 3 years and “forgets” what i ate 2 days ago. it can’t remember the most frequently used entry. and the sort order isn’t useful either. the most frequently used items are nowhere near the top.in the exercise section i have it set to sort by most recently used, but it sorts randomly. i do one exercise 3-4 times per week, but that is at the bottom of the menu, no matter how many times i set the sort order to “most frequent”. exercises i seldom use are at the top.the app also nags. i do not need a nanny. don’t nag about grams fat, protein, carbs, sodium, etc. when i complete the diary, i do not need a nag about how much i would weigh if i continued to eat & exercise the same. i do not use your app for weight loss. i have turned all the nagging off.your app requires use of expensive devices for tracking steps & diabetes management. it does not allow me to enter steps taken with a device that is not connected to the internet. it does not allow me to manage my diabetes without an expensive blood glucose monitor connected to the internet.on the website: i have been a paid subscriber since 2018. i use the website at least 4 times per week, mostly planning my week’s menus. i use the recipe maker extensively to add or modify existing recipes. the database to look up ingredients is a “mess”! for instance: looking up ground cumin (a spice) 1 teaspoonful is either 0 calories; 88 calories; 125 calories; 16 calories or 9 calories. for the record, i looked up the usda nutritional information for ground cumin and found that for 1 teaspoon the calorie range is between 8 and 9 calories.trying to look up previously entered recipe in your database is challenging. it is very time consuming to find a recipe previously entered into “your recipe box”. i must search page by page on the website to find the recipe i need to edit. i have over 49 pages to search to find the recipe i am seeking. the recipe box cannot be sorted or searched by key words.i have also recently discovered that if i copy a meal from a previous entry, delete one of the foods and add another, the app helpfully re-adds that food (the one i deleted) back in. i recently found it re-added a food 5 times on the previous day. i didn’t discover that until i tried to copy that meal into today’s log. 5 times!!!i have also noticed that your “help desk” does not want to interact with customers. i don’t want to chat! i would rather send an email explaining the problem and receive a reply. i don’t contact help often, only when i can’t find an answer by trying to navigate your byzantine help q&a. i got nothing useful asking about the app duplicating entries.your survey asked what value added features i would consider a “must have”. a searchable “your recipe box” is it.respectfully,",april sent letter week ago must received since received acknowledgement worth allow renewal go expect pay poor would recommend app anyone without reservation app friendly senior people limited manual month ago user fill online survey expect rate go renew subscription based upon question asked ask user valued provide list value ask anything use mobile app enter meal exercise useful anything else primarily use website desktop website user smart phone found app always remember food used past entering food meal frequently paired food offer food eaten year forgets ate day ago remember frequently used entry sort order useful either frequently used item nowhere near exercise section set sort recently used sort randomly one exercise time per week bottom menu matter many time set sort order frequent exercise seldom use app also nag need nanny nag gram fat protein carbs sodium etc complete diary need nag much would weigh continued eat exercise use app weight loss turned nagging app requires use expensive device tracking step diabetes management allow enter step taken device connected internet allow manage diabetes without expensive blood glucose monitor connected website paid subscriber since use website least time per week mostly planning week menu use recipe maker extensively add modify existing recipe database look ingredient mess instance looking ground cumin spice teaspoonful either calorie calorie calorie calorie calorie record looked usda nutritional information ground cumin found teaspoon calorie range look previously entered recipe database challenging time consuming find recipe previously entered recipe box must search page page website find recipe need edit page search find recipe seeking recipe box sorted searched key also recently discovered copy meal previous entry delete one food add another app helpfully food one deleted back recently found food time previous day discover tried copy meal today log time also noticed help desk want interact customer want chat would rather send email explaining problem receive reply contact help often find answer trying navigate byzantine help q got nothing useful asking app duplicating survey asked value added feature would consider must searchable recipe box,NEGATIVE,,april sent letter week ago must received since received acknowledgement worth allow renewal go expect pay poor would recommend app anyone without reservation app friendly senior people limited manual month ago user fill online survey expect rate go renew subscription based upon question asked ask user valued provide list value ask anything use mobile app enter meal exercise useful anything else primarily use website desktop website user smart phone found app always remember food used past entering food meal frequently paired food offer food eaten year forgets ate day ago remember frequently used entry sort order useful either frequently used item nowhere near exercise section set sort recently used sort randomly one exercise time per week bottom menu matter many time set sort order frequent exercise seldom use app also nag need nanny nag gram fat protein carbs sodium etc complete diary need nag much would weigh continued eat exercise use app weight loss turned nagging app requires use expensive device tracking step diabetes management allow enter step taken device connected internet allow manage diabetes without expensive blood glucose monitor connected website paid subscriber since use website least time per week mostly planning week menu use recipe maker extensively add modify existing recipe database look ingredient mess instance looking ground cumin spice teaspoonful either calorie calorie calorie calorie calorie record looked usda nutritional information ground cumin found teaspoon calorie range look previously entered recipe database challenging time consuming find recipe previously entered recipe box must search page page website find recipe need edit page search find recipe seeking recipe box sorted searched key also recently discovered copy meal previous entry delete one food add another app helpfully food one deleted back recently found food time previous day discover tried copy meal today log time also noticed help desk want interact customer want chat would rather send email explaining problem receive reply contact help often find answer trying navigate byzantine help q got nothing useful asking app duplicating survey asked value added feature would consider must searchable recipe box,neutral,

Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of snapshots. i love fitbit and am obsessed with my watch. over the past 4 years my fitbit has stopped working twice and both times they ask me to send it back and have sent me a brand new one! not many companies would do that so i think it's great. i generally find it so great for tracking all my exercise too and there’s so much you can do on the app. i would never move to any other watch and always recommend them. my fitbit stopped working, customer service was useless and just offered me discount on a new purchase. when i asked how to make a complaint they went from replying promptly to completely ignoring me. i only wish i'd read the reviews years ago as i certainly would've avoided this company. i know they had a premium service that could go in depth but now all basic functions are behind that paywall. my advice: use a different app. used to be a great app, now they have changed it so you need to pay for the most basic of functions. The app runs well most of the time but sometimes doesn't work as well. other than the negative, a good app. they need to sort the money business out. sort it out strava! good at dealing with specific enquiries on rides, but there are some long highlighted general issues that have been raised many times by different people. happy with the overall use of the site via a pc, not so much so on the app. going the paid route opens up so much more and this is both insightful and in my case, helps motivate me. i find the menu easy to navigate, and the info on calories and nutrients is very helpful. search function in “add a food” has some incorrect calorie counts. system automatically adds my exercise calories to my daily total. i can’t opt out of that without upgrading to premium. i have been using myfitnesspal for many years and i had bariatric surgery 3 years ago and this is a very handy tool to use to track. what i used to like i was able to scan my food for free. however now i write my food in because for scanning it isn't free anymore. i still like tracking calories even though i write them in.  myfitnesspal has become my de facto way of keeping track of calories. its accurate, extremely easy to use and would be difficult to do without. this app has a very extensive data base so makes it easy to track my daily food intake. My fitness pal is a brilliant app for managing everything linked to a healthy lifestyle. it is easy to use and if you subscribe to the premium service then you get fantastic value for money. i personally use the basic service for free as my only requirement is the food diary. you will not be disappointed using my fitness pal, and i will guarantee that. i've been using this app to track workouts and meals for years. i trust its data more than any other app i've used. it’s app is easy to use and they everything imaginable listed! i still use the free app and am tempted to try the updated version. Myfitnesspal is right on. always room for improvement, especially for people who don't eat processed food. having to continually put in ingredients i choose to eat is somewhat challenging, especially since i often substitute the alternative ingredients in recipes. i use mFP to track my weight and calories, and it has helped me achieve my fitness goals through the years. fitness pal is easy to use, to check my daily nutrients (calories, carbs, fiber, etc). most of my meal choices are already included in the data. The app is easy to use and perfect for managing my fitness goals. easy ti use and upload myfeedback which was welcomed by the company i bought from. i've been using it consistently for past 2 months and i'm literally seeing the results on weekly basis. i have been using this app daily for over a year. the workout feature is hit and miss, but basically it works well. it’s easy to communicate with other bikers in the community and share experiences. This app is simple to use and really helps me stay on track. wo helpful and easy. it does what i need it to do when i use it right. it has what i want. i’m a long time user and credit my fitness pal with providing both information and the discipline needed to first lose weight and then maintain. i have many friends who complain about not being able to lose weight but have no clue about how many calories, carbs, fats etc they consume. additionally they don’t understand how few calories are actually needed by the human body per day or the amount of exercise needed per day. i was recently diagnosed with gallbladder and liver issues. myfitnesspal has made it much easier to visualize if i’m achieving my macro and nutrient goals for those conditions. with their premium features, it has been worth it! i like that i can scan food to get the nutrition info. i started the south beach diet at my dr’s recommendation and found it hard to find information within the app to follow it. good to count calories and keep trsvk. expensive to go premium."

The app runs well most of the time but sometimes doesn't work as well. other than the negative, a good app. they need to sort the money business out. sort it out strava! good at dealing with specific enquiries on rides, but there are some long highlighted general issues that have been raised many times by different people. happy with the overall use of the site via a pc, not so much so on the app. going the paid route opens up so much more and this is both insightful and in my case, helps motivate me. i find the menu easy to navigate, and the info on calories and nutrients is very helpful. search function in “add a food” has some incorrect calorie counts. system automatically adds my exercise calories to my daily total. i can’t opt out of that without upgrading to premium. i have been using myfitnesspal for many years and i had bariatric surgery 3 years ago and this is a very handy tool to use to track. what i used to like i was able to scan my food for free. however now i write my food in because for scanning it isn't free anymore. i still like tracking calories even though i write them in.  myfitnesspal has become my de facto way of keeping track of calories. its accurate, extremely easy to use and would be difficult to do without. this app has a very extensive data base so makes it easy to track my daily food intake.

Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of snapshots. i love fitbit and am obsessed with my watch. over the past 4 years my fitbit has stopped working twice and both times they ask me to send it back and have sent me a brand new one! not many companies would do that so i think it's great. i generally find it so great for tracking all my exercise too and there’s so much you can do on the app. i would never move to any other watch and always recommend them. my fitbit stopped working, customer service was useless and just offered me discount on a new purchase. when i asked how to make a complaint they went from replying promptly to completely ignoring me. i only wish i'd read the reviews years ago as i certainly would've avoided this company. i know they had a premium service that could go in depth but now all basic functions are behind that paywall. my advice: use a different app. used to be a great app, now they have changed it so you need to pay for the most basic of functions. The app runs well most of the time but sometimes doesn't work as well. other than the negative, a good app. they need to sort the money business out. sort it out strava! good at dealing with specific enquiries on rides, but there are some long highlighted general issues that have been raised many times by different people. happy with the overall use of the site via a pc, not so much so on the app. going the paid route opens up so much more and this is both insightful and in my case, helps motivate me. i find the menu easy to navigate, and the info on calories and nutrients is very helpful. search function in “add a food” has some incorrect calorie counts. system automatically adds my exercise calories to my daily total. i can’t opt out of that without upgrading to premium. i have been using myfitnesspal for many years and i had bariatric surgery 3 years ago and this is a very handy tool to use to track. what i used to like i was able to scan my food for free. however now i write my food in because for scanning it isn't free anymore. i still like tracking calories even though i write them in.  myfitnesspal has become my de facto way of keeping track of calories. its accurate, extremely easy to use and would be difficult to do without. this app has a very extensive data base so makes it easy to track my daily food intake. My fitness pal is a brilliant app for managing everything linked to a healthy lifestyle. it is easy to use and if you subscribe to the premium service then you get fantastic value for money. i personally use the basic service for free as my only requirement is the food diary. you will not be disappointed using my fitness pal, and i will guarantee that. i've been using this app to track workouts and meals for years. i trust its data more than any other app i've used. it’s app is easy to use and they everything imaginable listed! i still use the free app and am tempted to try the updated version. Myfitnesspal is right on. always room for improvement, especially for people who don't eat processed food. having to continually put in ingredients i choose to eat is somewhat challenging, especially since i often substitute the alternative ingredients in recipes. i use mFP to track my weight and calories, and it has helped me achieve my fitness goals through the years. fitness pal is easy to use, to check my daily nutrients (calories, carbs, fiber, etc). most of my meal choices are already included in the data. The app is easy to use and perfect for managing my fitness goals. easy ti use and upload myfeedback which was welcomed by the company i bought from. i've been using it consistently for past 2 months and i'm literally seeing the results on weekly basis. i have been using this app daily for over a year. the workout feature is hit and miss, but basically it works well. it’s easy to communicate with other bikers in the community and share experiences. This app is simple to use and really helps me stay on track. wo helpful and easy. it does what i need it to do when i use it right. it has what i want. i’m a long time user and credit my fitness pal with providing both information and the discipline needed to first lose weight and then maintain. i have many friends who complain about not being able to lose weight but have no clue about how many calories, carbs, fats etc they consume. additionally they don’t understand how few calories are actually needed by the human body per day or the amount of exercise needed per day. i was recently diagnosed with gallbladder and liver issues. myfitnesspal has made it much easier to visualize if i’m achieving my macro and nutrient goals for those conditions. with their premium features, it has been worth it! i like that i can scan food to get the nutrition info. i started the south beach diet at my dr’s recommendation and found it hard to find information within the app to follow it. good to count calories and keep trsvk. expensive to go premium."

My fitness pal is a brilliant app for managing everything linked to a healthy lifestyle. it is easy to use and if you subscribe to the premium service then you get fantastic value for money. i personally use the basic service for free as my only requirement is the food diary. you will not be disappointed using my fitness pal, and i will guarantee that. i've been using this app to track workouts and meals for years. i trust its data more than any other app i've used. it’s app is easy to use and they everything imaginable listed! i still use the free app and am tempted to try the updated version. Myfitnesspal is right on. always room for improvement, especially for people who don't eat processed food. having to continually put in ingredients i choose to eat is somewhat challenging, especially since i often substitute the alternative ingredients in recipes. i use mFP to track my weight and calories, and it has helped me achieve my fitness goals through the years. fitness pal is easy to use, to check my daily nutrients (calories, carbs, fiber, etc). most of my meal choices are already included in the data. The app is easy to use and perfect for managing my fitness goals. easy ti use and upload myfeedback which was welcomed by the company i bought from. i've been using it consistently for past 2 months and i'm literally seeing the results on weekly basis. i have been using this app daily for over a year. the workout feature is hit and miss, but basically it works well. it’s easy to communicate with other bikers in the community and share experiences. This app is simple to use and really helps me stay on track. wo helpful and easy. it does what i need it to do when i use it right. it has what i want. i’m a long time user and credit my fitness pal with providing both information and the discipline needed to first lose weight and then maintain. i have many friends who complain about not being able to lose weight but have no clue about how many calories, carbs, fats etc they consume. additionally they don’t understand how few calories are actually needed by the human body per day or the amount of exercise needed per day. i was recently diagnosed with gallbladder and liver issues. myfitnesspal has made it much easier to visualize if i’m achieving my macro and nutrient goals for those conditions. with their premium features, it has been worth it! i like that i can scan food to get the nutrition info. i started the south beach diet at my dr’s recommendation and found it hard to find information within the app to follow it. good to count calories and keep trsvk. expensive to go premium."
keeps track of my carbs,keep track carbs,POSITIVE,keep track carbs,,neutral,
it keeps you healthy ,keep healthy,POSITIVE,keep healthy,,caring,"i am too traumatized to go into detail. my advice is to steer clear of this company. dealing with customer services is a surreal experience. a trustscore of 1 out of 5 should tell you all you need to know. An expensive bit of kit, which has been reliable for the two years i have owned it. my really big concern is having spent a lot of money on its initial purchase to really benefit you have to then pay to use all the functions within the app. knowing what i know now in no way, shape or form would buy another fitbit. realistically at its purchase the complete and full app should come with it all included. i don’t get fooled twice and i hope none of you out there get fooled once. i’m writing this regarding a versa 4 my wife bought for me as a christmas gift in december 2022. this watch recently died and could not be reset, less than 6 months after warranty ended. fitbit support offered a 35% discount on a new one instead of replacing it.  don't buy this product or do so at your own risk.  fitbit charge5 stopped syncing with the mobile app 12apr 2024. i bought it in april 2023. i tried all the steps available online and on the fitbit community forum. nothing worked. 16 apr 2024 - i had a live chat with fitbit onine. They were helpful and my fitbit is nowsyncing with mobile app. i was totally unaware they could do this, would not refund payment. be very careful if you use their app. it keeps you healthy  you help me stay on track, easy to use. if yiy switch phone they won't honor it they blame it on apple very dissatisfied customer."
thanks so much ,thanks much,POSITIVE,thanks much,,gratitude,
used this for years. fantastic,used year fantastic,POSITIVE,used year fantastic,,admiration,"Fitbit app used to be excellent. it is in decline unless you pay their monthly subscription! i paid £400 for a piece of tech and can only use its full potential if i keep paying! you can shove it fitbit, no doubt you are making fortunes using all the data you have on us too! i used to love my fitbit and have been a loyal customer for over a decade. the app was always great, simple to use, easy to read, good to see how you were doing over time. recently the app changed but the underlying sections remained usable, now the sleep app has been “updated” it is unusable. we comment but fitbit are ignoring us, time to look at other offerings. Sleep tracking is excellent, easy to use with a simple to learn ui. battery life is brilliant, last several days! superb fitness trackers with a very competitive prices. charge 5 worked perfectly and now i am on charge 6, which is just as good with a minor improvements, all adds up to very smooth user experience. great app for cyclists! it's my every day app for recording my sports activities. the segments feature is super addictive. no problem to pay 59 usd per year for it. keep up the good job by continuously adding features! great product and social experience with a positive effect. Each email takes 3-5 working days to get a response, and in my case the support agent took two of those emails to ask the same question twice (adding 10 days to the resolution) it took weeks to resolve a basic problem. a few months back i started tracking my walks. i do 2 miles a day minimum, and just being able to see all the data set me on my journey to lose weight and get fitter. i now use strava, and garmin app together. very good app. i can build my cycling routes easily and also share them with my fellow-cyclists. strava can connect with multiple cycling computers even those that are sold on aliexpress. which makes it easier to follow the routes i build in the strava app. i have been using strava for nearly 3 years. it's great an compatible with my apple watch. i have rated it 4 stars because the have removed feature, making them ""summit"" (premium) features. i use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great. excellent performance but the app hcrashes too much no, put a fix on it. only using the free app version so far for my runs and i really like it.  give it a go. Great website for tracking fitness activities. they could do with more premium features for runners. the site seems very geared towards cyclists. it's a great app, with information that can help people through any type of fitness journey. i appreciate the notifications throughout the day to log my meals. it's super easy to look up the foods i have either by the search bar or barcode. i'd like to see more nutrients/minerals in the nutrient breakdown tab. also less ads would be nice. App has helped me lose weight, eat better, exercise more, reach my goals and stay on track/maintain. great database for tracking food at meals, integration of data to/from other health apps and devices, nice goal setting/tracking features. Great app to track your calories and workouts! searching for food, it is a very thorough and complete database and very easy to find what you need for quick logins. The ability to make and save recipes is a great asset to the app! i've had for 3 years and it's been of invaluable help with my bulking and cutting bodybuilding cycles. brilliant bar code facility. would love if it was possible to duplicate items for multiple meals and days but other than that very user friendly. i’ve used this as a valuable tool to track my calories for the past 8 years. i like that u can put exercises in too. it helps to keep track of the days i exercise, all in one app. i'm amazed by how many foods are in the data bank. if the food i want is not there, i can usually find one similar. the posted columns are very useful and helpful. i especially like the recipes. It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what i'm eating. shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of premium for a pensioner is a little steep. Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight excellent app. taught me well about macro nutrition facts. it’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the upc - only accessible via the paid app. that was a greedy move. This app has helped me on my way of losing 38 pounds in about 3 months! tracking my food and nutritional values has led me to lose 95 lbs. i feel great, too! used for years!! great for calorie counting and keeping track of my nutrition values. Great app easy to use and excellent for daily use. so far the app has helped me lose 18 ibsbrilliant  it is easy to log your foods. has info on many foods and restaurants. great tool. helps me keep track of meals well. excellent as always the best app to use good app. easy to use  used this for years. fantastic my trainer arman at 24 our fitness set this app up for me so that i could track my progress. i also like the articles on recipes and nutritional information, and sometimes i try to make the dishes. the ability to find specific foods from stores and restaurants makes it easy to do your daily check in. another great feature is the bar code reader, meaning less typing. Great app, keeps me honest! really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. beautiful product with many options to assess your meals. i started using the app after a heart attack. i use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. it's great. The app helps me track my macros, so i can keep my protein and fat high and carbs low. functionality is great and relatively user friendly. the database often has any food i need. i've kept the extra weight off for 5 years now.  myfitnesspal is amazing! it has been a huge help in my weight loss journey. the food database is huge, and the barcode scanner makes logging meals super easy. it tracks my progress and syncs with my other fitness apps. highly recommend for anyone looking to get healthier!"
"my fitness pal is used for more than just weight loss!  i have had sigificant medical issues, had been put on a non amylose diet. i used mfp to make sure i was getting enough calories. when i started the diet you have to eat alot, most foods are low calorie. my husband suggested i start using it as i was feeling bad and he thought i might not be getting enough calories. he was right, i plugged in the foods and i was only eating 700 calories. i used the app to plan out the whole day to get enough calories, then figured out the right number to lose weight. using this app i lost 38 pounds since january of 2024. also had a problem with my stomach and had to use a liquid diet for 2 weeks. i was able to see the nutrition and the calories. learned my sodium was too low on the app and added salt. im still losing weight want to be 140, am very close now. will continue to use the app for nutrition info when i maintain my weight and if i start gaining will cut calories back to lose the extra and maintain my weight! thank you my fitness pal!!",fitness pal used weight loss sigificant medical issue put non amylose diet used mfp make sure getting enough calorie started diet eat alot food low calorie husband suggested start using feeling bad thought might getting enough calorie right plugged food eating calorie used app plan whole day get enough calorie figured right number lose weight using app lost pound since january also problem stomach use liquid diet week able see nutrition calorie learned sodium low app added salt im still losing weight want close continue use app nutrition info maintain weight start gaining cut calorie back lose extra maintain weight thank fitness pal,NEGATIVE,,fitness pal used weight loss sigificant medical issue put non amylose diet used mfp make sure getting enough calorie started diet eat alot food low calorie husband suggested start using feeling bad thought might getting enough calorie right plugged food eating calorie used app plan whole day get enough calorie figured right number lose weight using app lost pound since january also problem stomach use liquid diet week able see nutrition calorie learned sodium low app added salt im still losing weight want close continue use app nutrition info maintain weight start gaining cut calorie back lose extra maintain weight thank fitness pal,neutral,
company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features,company gone downhill since price locking basic feature,NEGATIVE,,company gone downhill since price locking basic feature,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs.

my trainer arman at 24 our fitness set this app up for me so that i could track my progress. it has been amazing how helpful it has been.,trainer arman fitness set app could track progress amazing helpful,POSITIVE,trainer arman fitness set app could track progress amazing helpful,,admiration,"Fitbit app used to be excellent. it is in decline unless you pay their monthly subscription! i paid £400 for a piece of tech and can only use its full potential if i keep paying! you can shove it fitbit, no doubt you are making fortunes using all the data you have on us too! i used to love my fitbit and have been a loyal customer for over a decade. the app was always great, simple to use, easy to read, good to see how you were doing over time. recently the app changed but the underlying sections remained usable, now the sleep app has been “updated” it is unusable. we comment but fitbit are ignoring us, time to look at other offerings. Sleep tracking is excellent, easy to use with a simple to learn ui. battery life is brilliant, last several days! superb fitness trackers with a very competitive prices. charge 5 worked perfectly and now i am on charge 6, which is just as good with a minor improvements, all adds up to very smooth user experience. great app for cyclists! it's my every day app for recording my sports activities. the segments feature is super addictive. no problem to pay 59 usd per year for it. keep up the good job by continuously adding features! great product and social experience with a positive effect. Each email takes 3-5 working days to get a response, and in my case the support agent took two of those emails to ask the same question twice (adding 10 days to the resolution) it took weeks to resolve a basic problem. a few months back i started tracking my walks. i do 2 miles a day minimum, and just being able to see all the data set me on my journey to lose weight and get fitter. i now use strava, and garmin app together. very good app. i can build my cycling routes easily and also share them with my fellow-cyclists. strava can connect with multiple cycling computers even those that are sold on aliexpress. which makes it easier to follow the routes i build in the strava app. i have been using strava for nearly 3 years. it's great an compatible with my apple watch. i have rated it 4 stars because the have removed feature, making them ""summit"" (premium) features. i use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great. excellent performance but the app hcrashes too much no, put a fix on it. only using the free app version so far for my runs and i really like it.  give it a go. Great website for tracking fitness activities. they could do with more premium features for runners. the site seems very geared towards cyclists. it's a great app, with information that can help people through any type of fitness journey. i appreciate the notifications throughout the day to log my meals. it's super easy to look up the foods i have either by the search bar or barcode. i'd like to see more nutrients/minerals in the nutrient breakdown tab. also less ads would be nice. App has helped me lose weight, eat better, exercise more, reach my goals and stay on track/maintain. great database for tracking food at meals, integration of data to/from other health apps and devices, nice goal setting/tracking features. Great app to track your calories and workouts! searching for food, it is a very thorough and complete database and very easy to find what you need for quick logins. The ability to make and save recipes is a great asset to the app! i've had for 3 years and it's been of invaluable help with my bulking and cutting bodybuilding cycles. brilliant bar code facility. would love if it was possible to duplicate items for multiple meals and days but other than that very user friendly. i’ve used this as a valuable tool to track my calories for the past 8 years. i like that u can put exercises in too. it helps to keep track of the days i exercise, all in one app. i'm amazed by how many foods are in the data bank. if the food i want is not there, i can usually find one similar. the posted columns are very useful and helpful. i especially like the recipes. It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what i'm eating. shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of premium for a pensioner is a little steep. Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight excellent app. taught me well about macro nutrition facts. it’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the upc - only accessible via the paid app. that was a greedy move. This app has helped me on my way of losing 38 pounds in about 3 months! tracking my food and nutritional values has led me to lose 95 lbs. i feel great, too! used for years!! great for calorie counting and keeping track of my nutrition values. Great app easy to use and excellent for daily use. so far the app has helped me lose 18 ibsbrilliant  it is easy to log your foods. has info on many foods and restaurants. great tool. helps me keep track of meals well. excellent as always the best app to use good app. easy to use  used this for years. fantastic my trainer arman at 24 our fitness set this app up for me so that i could track my progress. i also like the articles on recipes and nutritional information, and sometimes i try to make the dishes. the ability to find specific foods from stores and restaurants makes it easy to do your daily check in. another great feature is the bar code reader, meaning less typing. Great app, keeps me honest! really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. beautiful product with many options to assess your meals. i started using the app after a heart attack. i use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. it's great. The app helps me track my macros, so i can keep my protein and fat high and carbs low. functionality is great and relatively user friendly. the database often has any food i need. i've kept the extra weight off for 5 years now.  myfitnesspal is amazing! it has been a huge help in my weight loss journey. the food database is huge, and the barcode scanner makes logging meals super easy. it tracks my progress and syncs with my other fitness apps. highly recommend for anyone looking to get healthier!"
you do help me track my calories. disappointed that the scan option isn’t available anymore.,help track calorie disappointed scan option available anymore,NEGATIVE,,help track calorie disappointed scan option available anymore,disappointment,"Fitbit has lost me as a customer. There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

Each email takes 3-5 working days to get a response, and in my case the support agent took two of those emails to ask the same question twice (adding 10 days to the resolution) it took weeks to resolve a basic problem. a few months back i started tracking my walks. i do 2 miles a day minimum, and just being able to see all the data set me on my journey to lose weight and get fitter. i now use strava, and garmin app together. very good app. i can build my cycling routes easily and also share them with my fellow-cyclists. strava can connect with multiple cycling computers even those that are sold on aliexpress. which makes it easier to follow the routes i build in the strava app. i have been using strava for nearly 3 years. it's great an compatible with my apple watch. i have rated it 4 stars because the have removed feature, making them ""summit"" (premium) features. i use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great. excellent performance but the app hcrashes too much no, put a fix on it. only using the free app version so far for my runs and i really like it.  give it a go.

It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what i'm eating. shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of premium for a pensioner is a little steep. Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight excellent app. taught me well about macro nutrition facts. it’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the upc - only accessible via the paid app. that was a greedy move.

Great app, keeps me honest! really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. beautiful product with many options to assess your meals. i started using the app after a heart attack. i use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. it's great.

Please submit your best shots of New York for next week. Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of snapshots. i love fitbit and am obsessed with my watch. over the past 4 years my fitbit has stopped working twice and both times they ask me to send it back and have sent me a brand new one! not many companies would do that so i think it's great. i generally find it so great for tracking all my exercise too and there’s so much you can do on the app. i would never move to any other watch and always recommend them. my fitbit stopped working, customer service was useless and just offered me discount on a new purchase. when i asked how to make a complaint they went from replying promptly to completely ignoring me. i only wish i'd read the reviews years ago as i certainly would've avoided this company. i know they had a premium service that could go in depth but now all basic functions are behind that paywall. my advice: use a different app. used to be a great app, now they have changed it so you need to pay for the most basic of functions. The app runs well most of the time but sometimes doesn't work as well. other than the negative, a good app. they need to sort the money business out. sort it out strava! good at dealing with specific enquiries on rides, but there are some long highlighted general issues that have been raised many times by different people. happy with the overall use of the site via a pc, not so much so on the app. going the paid route opens up so much more and this is both insightful and in my case, helps motivate me. i find the menu easy to navigate, and the info on calories and nutrients is very helpful. search function in “add a food” has some incorrect calorie counts. system automatically adds my exercise calories to my daily total. i can’t opt out of that without upgrading to premium. i have been using myfitnesspal for many years and i had bariatric surgery 3 years ago and this is a very handy tool to use to track. what i used to like i was able to scan my food for free. however now i write my food in because for scanning it isn't free anymore. i still like tracking calories even though i write them in.  myfitnesspal has become my de facto way of keeping track of calories. its accurate, extremely easy to use and would be difficult to do without. this app has a very extensive data base so makes it easy to track my daily food intake. My fitness pal is a brilliant app for managing everything linked to a healthy lifestyle. it is easy to use and if you subscribe to the premium service then you get fantastic value for money. i personally use the basic service for free as my only requirement is the food diary. you will not be disappointed using my fitness pal, and i will guarantee that. i've been using this app to track workouts and meals for years. i trust its data more than any other app i've used. it’s app is easy to use and they everything imaginable listed! i still use the free app and am tempted to try the updated version. Myfitnesspal is right on. always room for improvement, especially for people who don't eat processed food. having to continually put in ingredients i choose to eat is somewhat challenging, especially since i often substitute the alternative ingredients in recipes. i use mFP to track my weight and calories, and it has helped me achieve my fitness goals through the years. fitness pal is easy to use, to check my daily nutrients (calories, carbs, fiber, etc). most of my meal choices are already included in the data. The app is easy to use and perfect for managing my fitness goals. easy ti use and upload myfeedback which was welcomed by the company i bought from. i've been using it consistently for past 2 months and i'm literally seeing the results on weekly basis. i have been using this app daily for over a year. the workout feature is hit and miss, but basically it works well. it’s easy to communicate with other bikers in the community and share experiences. This app is simple to use and really helps me stay on track. wo helpful and easy. it does what i need it to do when i use it right. it has what i want. i’m a long time user and credit my fitness pal with providing both information and the discipline needed to first lose weight and then maintain. i have many friends who complain about not being able to lose weight but have no clue about how many calories, carbs, fats etc they consume. additionally they don’t understand how few calories are actually needed by the human body per day or the amount of exercise needed per day. i was recently diagnosed with gallbladder and liver issues. myfitnesspal has made it much easier to visualize if i’m achieving my macro and nutrient goals for those conditions. with their premium features, it has been worth it! i like that i can scan food to get the nutrition info. i started the south beach diet at my dr’s recommendation and found it hard to find information within the app to follow it. good to count calories and keep trsvk. expensive to go premium."
"i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories on that meal. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing ",like idea sign premium able scan bar code new food also frustrating meal double delete half get meal correct calorie meal mine husband phone thing,NEGATIVE,,like idea sign premium able scan bar code new food also frustrating meal double delete half get meal correct calorie meal mine husband phone thing,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"
"i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support, after years of building relationships.

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

Each email takes 3-5 working days to get a response, and in my case the support agent took two of those emails to ask the same question twice (adding 10 days to the resolution) it took weeks to resolve a basic problem. a few months back i started tracking my walks. i do 2 miles a day minimum, and just being able to see all the data set me on my journey to lose weight and get fitter. i now use strava, and garmin app together. very good app. i can build my cycling routes easily and also share them with my fellow-cyclists. strava can connect with multiple cycling computers even those that are sold on aliexpress. which makes it easier to follow the routes i build in the strava app. i have been using strava for nearly 3 years. it's great an compatible with my apple watch. i have rated it 4 stars because the have removed feature, making them ""summit"" (premium) features. i use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great. excellent performance but the app hcrashes too much no, put a fix on it. only using the free app version so far for my runs and i really like it.  give it a go. Great website for tracking fitness activities. they could do with more premium features for runners. the site seems very geared towards cyclists. it's a great app, with information that can help people through any type of fitness journey. i appreciate the notifications throughout the day to log my meals. it's super easy to look up the foods i have either by the search bar or barcode. i'd like to see more nutrients/minerals in the nutrient breakdown tab. also less ads would be nice. App has helped me lose weight, eat better, exercise more, reach my goals and stay on track/maintain. great database for tracking food at meals, integration of data to/from other health apps and devices, nice goal setting/tracking features. Great app to track your calories and workouts! searching for food, it is a very thorough and complete database and very easy to find what you need for quick logins. The ability to make and save recipes is a great asset to the app! i've had for 3 years and it's been of invaluable help with my bulking and cutting bodybuilding cycles. brilliant bar code facility. would love if it was possible to duplicate items for multiple meals and days but other than that very user friendly. i’ve used this as a valuable tool to track my calories for the past 8 years. i like that u can put exercises in too. it helps to keep track of the days i exercise, all in one app. i'm amazed by how many foods are in the data bank. if the food i want is not there, i can usually find one similar. the posted columns are very useful and helpful. i especially like the recipes. It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what i'm eating. shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of premium for a pensioner is a little steep. Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight excellent app. taught me well about macro nutrition facts. it’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the upc - only accessible via the paid app. that was a greedy move. This app has helped me on my way of losing 38 pounds in about 3 months! tracking my food and nutritional values has led me to lose 95 lbs. i feel great, too! used for years!! great for calorie counting and keeping track of my nutrition values. Great app easy to use and excellent for daily use. so far the app has helped me lose 18 ibsbrilliant  it is easy to log your foods. has info on many foods and restaurants. great tool. helps me keep track of meals well. excellent as always the best app to use good app. easy to use  used this for years. fantastic my trainer arman at 24 our fitness set this app up for me so that i could track my progress. i also like the articles on recipes and nutritional information, and sometimes i try to make the dishes. the ability to find specific foods from stores and restaurants makes it easy to do your daily check in. another great feature is the bar code reader, meaning less typing. Great app, keeps me honest! really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. beautiful product with many options to assess your meals. i started using the app after a heart attack. i use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. it's great. The app helps me track my macros, so i can keep my protein and fat high and carbs low. functionality is great and relatively user friendly. the database often has any food i need. i've kept the extra weight off for 5 years now.  myfitnesspal is amazing! it has been a huge help in my weight loss journey. the food database is huge, and the barcode scanner makes logging meals super easy. it tracks my progress and syncs with my other fitness apps. highly recommend for anyone looking to get healthier!"

Please submit your best shots of New York for next week. Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of snapshots. i love fitbit and am obsessed with my watch. over the past 4 years my fitbit has stopped working twice and both times they ask me to send it back and have sent me a brand new one! not many companies would do that so i think it's great. i generally find it so great for tracking all my exercise too and there’s so much you can do on the app. i would never move to any other watch and always recommend them. my fitbit stopped working, customer service was useless and just offered me discount on a new purchase. when i asked how to make a complaint they went from replying promptly to completely ignoring me. i only wish i'd read the reviews years ago as i certainly would've avoided this company. i know they had a premium service that could go in depth but now all basic functions are behind that paywall. my advice: use a different app. used to be a great app, now they have changed it so you need to pay for the most basic of functions. The app runs well most of the time but sometimes doesn't work as well. other than the negative, a good app. they need to sort the money business out. sort it out strava! good at dealing with specific enquiries on rides, but there are some long highlighted general issues that have been raised many times by different people. happy with the overall use of the site via a pc, not so much so on the app. going the paid route opens up so much more and this is both insightful and in my case, helps motivate me. i find the menu easy to navigate, and the info on calories and nutrients is very helpful. search function in “add a food” has some incorrect calorie counts. system automatically adds my exercise calories to my daily total. i can’t opt out of that without upgrading to premium. i have been using myfitnesspal for many years and i had bariatric surgery 3 years ago and this is a very handy tool to use to track. what i used to like i was able to scan my food for free. however now i write my food in because for scanning it isn't free anymore. i still like tracking calories even though i write them in.  myfitnesspal has become my de facto way of keeping track of calories. its accurate, extremely easy to use and would be difficult to do without. this app has a very extensive data base so makes it easy to track my daily food intake. My fitness pal is a brilliant app for managing everything linked to a healthy lifestyle. it is easy to use and if you subscribe to the premium service then you get fantastic value for money. i personally use the basic service for free as my only requirement is the food diary. you will not be disappointed using my fitness pal, and i will guarantee that. i've been using this app to track workouts and meals for years. i trust its data more than any other app i've used. it’s app is easy to use and they everything imaginable listed! i still use the free app and am tempted to try the updated version. Myfitnesspal is right on. always room for improvement, especially for people who don't eat processed food. having to continually put in ingredients i choose to eat is somewhat challenging, especially since i often substitute the alternative ingredients in recipes. i use mFP to track my weight and calories, and it has helped me achieve my fitness goals through the years. fitness pal is easy to use, to check my daily nutrients (calories, carbs, fiber, etc). most of my meal choices are already included in the data. The app is easy to use and perfect for managing my fitness goals. easy ti use and upload myfeedback which was welcomed by the company i bought from. i've been using it consistently for past 2 months and i'm literally seeing the results on weekly basis. i have been using this app daily for over a year. the workout feature is hit and miss, but basically it works well. it’s easy to communicate with other bikers in the community and share experiences. This app is simple to use and really helps me stay on track. wo helpful and easy. it does what i need it to do when i use it right. it has what i want. i’m a long time user and credit my fitness pal with providing both information and the discipline needed to first lose weight and then maintain. i have many friends who complain about not being able to lose weight but have no clue about how many calories, carbs, fats etc they consume. additionally they don’t understand how few calories are actually needed by the human body per day or the amount of exercise needed per day. i was recently diagnosed with gallbladder and liver issues. myfitnesspal has made it much easier to visualize if i’m achieving my macro and nutrient goals for those conditions. with their premium features, it has been worth it! i like that i can scan food to get the nutrition info. i started the south beach diet at my dr’s recommendation and found it hard to find information within the app to follow it. good to count calories and keep trsvk. expensive to go premium."
not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. the free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. the nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. i want to see the individual nutrients ,syncing consistently fitbit app free app food search toolbar seems awkward compared month ago nutrient tab annoying page first basically useless want see individual nutrient,NEGATIVE,,syncing consistently fitbit app free app food search toolbar seems awkward compared month ago nutrient tab annoying page first basically useless want see individual nutrient,annoyance,"i am beyond frustrated. i’ve been a fitbit customer since 2012.   until i got a new fitbit watch for christmas, i”ve had no problems.  now, it is nothing but problems. the watch will stop tracking random metrics. it drops the bluetooth connection with my phone and the watch has to be reset twice ( first reset results in a red x, second one works) i purchased the fitbit two months ago. it didn't charge and stop working. they asked me to send only the watch, but the charger was defected. after hours of my time wasted, i decided to order the replacement on amazon. the chat was long and irritating. can offer 30 percent off a new one and they put the phone down shocking don’t buy their watches and all the customer service speak indian or pakistani shocking. awful customer service rang for help has my watch wouldn't sync to the app made me hard reset my watch now it won't even turn on and now they saying the watch was faulty.  fitbit charge 3 defective screen again tried all fixes fried reboot tried clock face change in fact tried everything fed up now it’s only fit for the bin most expensive waste of money ever. First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

First 2 faulty and eventually replaced - replacement lasted a few months. neither lasted a year. now out of the 1 year warranty - fitbit offered 35% of rrp not actual current selling price - so basically £20 off a new watch. company really couldn't care less once out of warranty- shoddy don't buy it!!  purchased fitbit sense 2 back in march. it suddenly completely stopped working! no charging, when trying to reset just shows a big red cross. raised a ticket, emailed them no reply. just ridiculous. i should have checked trust pilots reviews before purchasing, but trusted a well known company backed by google. big mistake! how can a company have 1.3 star average??? never seen this before! i have never had such poor customer service my wife’s fitbit has issues and after the first couple of email they refuse to respond, so so not waste your money on this rubbish item get an apple watch  what a waste of money. charge 5 good when working but stopped suddenly and now won't work at all. goes back to the question of firmware updates causing issues if you ask me as all was fine. i would give minus 10 i would. longtime fitbit customer here with multiple devices. will never use again. customer service so bad they just cut me off mid sentence.  if i could give minus ten i would, but i can't. i had a fit bit luxe. two times shortly after the warranty was up it failed and needed to be replaced. their 35 percent off your next product worked on me the first time but no more. it is absurd that basically a pedometer needs to replaced every two years. as far as i see it , it is a self perpetuating business. 18 months of use, a green light on the back of the charge 5 stays on constantly running the battery down in about 5 to 7 hours. it's basically useless at this point and customer service either makes excuses or doesn't respond. for what it is, it's way too expensive. should be a $19.95 late night special! Customer service was awful. Failed to rectify an issue so gave a review of 1 for their customer service review. since then i have not been able to sync the device. clearly been blocked by staff as a result. just about tells the time accurately, that’s it. Fitbit is better suited to a xmas cracker gift or as a cheap offer from toys r us. rubbish app and interface. never works effectively or logs coaching sessions. unit is much smaller than garmin fenix 7x pro. ""Total crap. zero customer support, couldn't find how to register fitbit premium, the display is naff just like the app, to be honest it's total crap. ive only had it two days and i'm taking it back"" ""I was actually warned its total garbage, i should have read some reviews first"" i do not recommend fitbit to anyone,  look for something better which is not difficult now. once my free trial of premium is up i'm switching providers. since google has taken over it seems every update ruins the app even more. The watch doesn't update the roaming country time until fitbit app on the phone is started....useless watch really. fitbit doesn't allow amex uk contactless pay even with the latest google wallet replacement to fitbit pay. Software is crap and the product is soooooo cheap. it's only designed to sell you something!!  it is so buggy it cannot be used--raise your wrist to turn it on never works. i'm appalled by fitbit's subpar service. a class-action lawsuit may be necessary to hold fitbit accountable for their negligence. i'll be taking my business elsewhere, avoiding monthly payments for inadequate service. Used fitbit for a few months, now it's completely dead. no charge, no screen, nothing. don't even know how to contact customer service. total waste. versa 4 would not charge after 4 months. they should be ashamed of themselves. i got useless unhelpful messages. they will surely go out of business. The only reason i bought this was to see my sleep quality. stopped using after a few months, the fitbit came with free premium access. then they took 80 for a premium renewal without any notification and cant contact! Kids ace 3 fitbits bought 2, none of them work four months later. absolute shambles. can’t get any help! do not buy you have been warned! Do you have a story to share with the world? Send it to us!  avoid i have a fitbit that is just over 2 years old not working told i’m just out of warranty and they will not replace it but gave me a link with 35%discount. reluctantly i decided to use the discount and replace watch i have now endured 3 days on the chat being asked stupid questions and getting sent links that don’t work appalling robotic customer service. i bought a fitbit ace 3 for my daughter. would not connect to the app. absolute waste of money. customer care is non existent. please do not buy. total waste of time. returned. A year ago i would have given fitbit 5 stars but they have utterly destroyed the best part of the fitbit experience: the app. back in october, they totally revamped it, changing the look & layout of it and it is an absolute nightmare to navigate now. they won’t listen to their customers and it seems, since google took over, they’re slowly phasing out fitbit. i think it is time to throw the fitbit away and buy something else that has nothing to do with google. sat here 2 hours trying to sync my phone, bluetooth error, uninstall install again. nothing, so bad. waste of money and time. Fitbit is a con. they offered a year's free premium service, which i signed up for, only to find that six months later they tried to take £79.99 out of my account. spent ages trying to resolve this, but customer service execs are very well groomed in polite ""screw yous"". avoid. i wish i would have read trustpilot before i invested in the charge 6. i'm on my 2nd... yes 2nd replacement because the first 2 stopped tracking only 2 months after wearing. of course no refund... but heck yeah they'll give me watchband to make up for it. total waste of money! Despite my fitbit sense 2 working in most respects, the weather app & oxygen reader are both never-ending sources of frustration. no matter what i do the fitbit weather app is always off by 2-4 degrees when compared to our (australian) bureau of meteorology. as i'm asthmatic with copd i need to know my oxygen level before a workout so i do find it incredibly annoying considering how much i paid for a watch. i cancelled my trial/subscription many months ago and now see a payment taken from my account. there is no way to contact them. i submitted a request via the online form which took hours to find. companies which exist to cheat people out of money should be penalised and made a thing of the past. strava, please refund me my money. constuctive: the most unreliable and useless fitness tracking app i have used, it records if it feels like it, usually on a day when i would really like to see the stats it deletes them or wipes them out. honestly: its rubbish. No warning of subscription renewal, no receipt email as in  2021 - asked to cancel next day after spotted payment. no. this is the entire money making model and it's even worse than amazon policy on prime. next year it's calendared and i'm out for this reason. This company is horrendous to deal with. the support is virtually non existent. expect to be ignored for weeks or months. as somebody else has mentioned there are clear red flags with this company.ps i literally created a trustpilot account just to write this single review. i don't know why people think this app is good? its interface is absolute crap and non intuitive. the home screen looks like a dog vomitted into my phone. one star is way too much, people rating it more than 1 star must have very low expectations and must be blown away when they use a well developed app. i call the customer service number and no one answers, i leave a voicemail and noOne returns the call, i send an email and get a response in a week but the response indicates that the customer services person is unfamiliar with the app.  they want to play the ""you find your own answer in our list of faq's"".  strava has joined theCustomer service race to the bottom. i had to cancel my credit card and all, they took a bit of money everyday from my account. stay away from it as far as you can. a reaaaal scam, i didn't even know this thing until 170$ have been taken off from my accounts. Strava is the worst app ever! it does not stop to harass you to buy the premium version! hard to remove the annoying messages off screen, it misses my trips entirely very often! and again, keeps pushing the premium for you to buying it again and again andAgain!! should i say more?? seriously, strava dudes, i am running or walking for fun, i don’t need your super expensive subscription! i am done with i you!! as my friends are!! ""absolute rubbish. consistently fails to track my activities, great straight lines into nowhere and the timing all messed up. don't bother"" ""they underhandedly and misleading pushed me into subscribing for their premium service. when i realised that i was going to be charged i cancelled my presciption but it wouldn't update and they took my money""  premium prices are crazy and absolutely not worth it considering you barely get anything extra. don't launch a massive marketing push if you don't have the staff to deal with the expected rush in sign ups. i upgraded my membership but was unable to access the premium features so sent an email 3 weeks later and not a sign of a reply. really terrible customer service. Customer service is non existent. so hard to cancel and get refund after trial period has finished. don't sign up, the original service was so much better. once upon a time this was the leading app for tracking exercise, now theyve become greedy and want folk to pay. i am so livid. the free trial is a scam. i signed up and set a reminder to cancel before being charged. well, every time i went to cancel it ""glitched"" and i ended up be charged. so i emailed, filed a complaint with paypal and left a bad review before i could get anyone's attention. they claimed the canceled. well i just got charged again. it's not even worth it. Watt/hrr/speed never corollate with garmin or trainingpeaks values - annoying. beware of the ""free trial"". they charged my credit card with no warning and no authorization. i felt tricked, and although i liked the app, i cancelled the service. i've been on 10 rides and it has only recorded one of them. getting fed up of being harassed to subscribe. awful support even when paid subscription and stripped site of features when not. try a different app. i am sick and tired of strava telling me who i should give kudos to. that is an intrusion on my privacy. people i don't know from adam and it's telling me I should give them kudos. weird!  let me get this straight, i am suppose to pay for an app to tell me who to giveKudos to? no way! rubbish. Only a muppet would pay these thieves for such a shoddy service. spent $60 for year subscription and they charge my card. my paid account no longer exists 3 months later. sent 3 open tickets and no response!! i've contacted them multiple times over multiple months to try and sort my account but they initially reply with a template response that is beyond useless and then ignore all my other messages! come on it's a great product but the customer service is beyond terrible. why would anyone ever sign up for the paid plan? The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

Sleep tracking is excellent, easy to use with a simple to learn ui. battery life is brilliant, last several days! superb fitness trackers with a very competitive prices. charge 5 worked perfectly and now i am on charge 6, which is just as good with a minor improvements, all adds up to very smooth user experience. great app for cyclists! it's my every day app for recording my sports activities. the segments feature is super addictive. no problem to pay 59 usd per year for it. keep up the good job by continuously adding features! great product and social experience with a positive effect. Each email takes 3-5 working days to get a response, and in my case the support agent took two of those emails to ask the same question twice (adding 10 days to the resolution) it took weeks to resolve a basic problem. a few months back i started tracking my walks. i do 2 miles a day minimum, and just being able to see all the data set me on my journey to lose weight and get fitter. i now use strava, and garmin app together. very good app. i can build my cycling routes easily and also share them with my fellow-cyclists. strava can connect with multiple cycling computers even those that are sold on aliexpress. which makes it easier to follow the routes i build in the strava app. i have been using strava for nearly 3 years. it's great an compatible with my apple watch. i have rated it 4 stars because the have removed feature, making them ""summit"" (premium) features. i use this almost daily and apart from the dodgy route planner find the website and app interfaces great. excellent performance but the app hcrashes too much no, put a fix on it. only using the free app version so far for my runs and i really like it.  give it a go. Great website for tracking fitness activities. they could do with more premium features for runners. the site seems very geared towards cyclists. it's a great app, with information that can help people through any type of fitness journey. i appreciate the notifications throughout the day to log my meals. it's super easy to look up the foods i have either by the search bar or barcode. i'd like to see more nutrients/minerals in the nutrient breakdown tab. also less ads would be nice. App has helped me lose weight, eat better, exercise more, reach my goals and stay on track/maintain. great database for tracking food at meals, integration of data to/from other health apps and devices, nice goal setting/tracking features. Great app to track your calories and workouts! searching for food, it is a very thorough and complete database and very easy to find what you need for quick logins. The ability to make and save recipes is a great asset to the app! i've had for 3 years and it's been of invaluable help with my bulking and cutting bodybuilding cycles. brilliant bar code facility. would love if it was possible to duplicate items for multiple meals and days but other than that very user friendly. i’ve used this as a valuable tool to track my calories for the past 8 years. i like that u can put exercises in too. it helps to keep track of the days i exercise, all in one app. i'm amazed by how many foods are in the data bank. if the food i want is not there, i can usually find one similar. the posted columns are very useful and helpful. i especially like the recipes. It's a great app, never a problem with it, like some other apps. great for counting calories & helping me keep track of what i'm eating. shame about the constant bombardment of ads., and the price of premium for a pensioner is a little steep. Great way to track food, and keep on target when loosing or maintaining weight excellent app. taught me well about macro nutrition facts. it’s a good tracking app, however they made the best feature - the ability to scan the upc - only accessible via the paid app. that was a greedy move. This app has helped me on my way of losing 38 pounds in about 3 months! tracking my food and nutritional values has led me to lose 95 lbs. i feel great, too! used for years!! great for calorie counting and keeping track of my nutrition values. Great app easy to use and excellent for daily use. so far the app has helped me lose 18 ibsbrilliant  it is easy to log your foods. has info on many foods and restaurants. great tool. helps me keep track of meals well. excellent as always the best app to use good app. easy to use  used this for years. fantastic my trainer arman at 24 our fitness set this app up for me so that i could track my progress. i also like the articles on recipes and nutritional information, and sometimes i try to make the dishes. the ability to find specific foods from stores and restaurants makes it easy to do your daily check in. another great feature is the bar code reader, meaning less typing. Great app, keeps me honest! really empowers me to reach my fitness goals. beautiful product with many options to assess your meals. i started using the app after a heart attack. i use it track calories, fat, sodium and exercise. it's great. The app helps me track my macros, so i can keep my protein and fat high and carbs low. functionality is great and relatively user friendly. the database often has any food i need. i've kept the extra weight off for 5 years now.  myfitnesspal is amazing! it has been a huge help in my weight loss journey. the food database is huge, and the barcode scanner makes logging meals super easy. it tracks my progress and syncs with my other fitness apps. highly recommend for anyone looking to get healthier!"

The new viral scale on tik tok comes with a free app to scan and log your intake as well as your macros. paying an arm and a leg to scan things is absolutely ridiculous! i have used for 1,240 without a break. obviously i am finding it useful for nutrition balance and tracking calories. i am an endurance cyclist and it helps match my intake to my exercise. in this respect one needs to take account of secondary activities such as walking, house and garden. i waste so much time ""searching"" for a particular food. i don't care to pay for the premium service, which they are always pressing me for. i dislike that the scan is behind a paywall now, and the exercise sync is terrible. i do like the idea now that you have to sign up for ""premium"" to be able to scan bar codes for new foods. and also very frustrating to have a meal double by itself where i have to delete half to get my meal correct for calories. its mine and my husband's phones do the same thing  Not syncing consistently with my fitbit app. Free app food search toolbar seems awkward now as compared to 6 months ago. nutrients tab has an annoying page now at first that's basically useless. been using this for 2 years with no drama and now it doesn't work. £15.99 for such a useless app that i used probably once and forgot all about! with no free trail end reminders because they know they’re useless and you’d cancel so they have an awful no refund policy. what a scam!"

There must be better products out there. had a fitbit sense for 2 years went swimming 3 times with watch 3rd time watch failed. last fitbit also lasted 2 years. i am deeply disappointed with the service i’ve experienced. after just six months, the product i purchased stopped working. despite making it clear that i do not speak dutch, your staff continued to communicate in dutch. this is disrespectful and unacceptable, particularly for a company with international customers. i expected much better from your company. do not recomend it! disappointing product and customer service!! i bought my first fitbit in 2018 and got really use to using it-even if the text notification quit working after 1 year and no one would or could help me fix that. so i decided it was a fluke that everything slowly quit working on it and charging it all the time was painful. i bought the charge 6 november 2023. this has been the worst decision in a long time! it had so many issues and customer service has been of no help. and this forcing to use google for it really stinks. i wish i had not wasted my money. The Apple Watch was acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion in 2012. The company has not released any new watches since the acquisition. Apple has also not released new apps or watch faces since the purchase. Wristband broke on second wearing. control buttons poor and hard to use. watch didn't synce in with my phone, i contacted fitbit but they told me that they wouldn't honor my warranty and didn't accommodate me in anyway. The app is now terrible - you can't customise automatically tracked activities, it glitches constantly, and doesn't accurately track many of the things it used to. i talked to customer service and they said they'd send me an email to leave feedback, which never came. wouldn't buy another fitbit device in the future. Fitnessbit charge 6 kept turning off for no reason, after some research it's a known glitch but still had to have 4 drawn out ""troubleshooting"" calls. Returned watch and charger but a week later only watch came back, back to support. Customer service is shocking, only had my fitbit 2 months and every week there is an issue. i’ve called fitbit and emailed them several times, no response back or when i do get someone, there is just no solution! i’ve had to get a new fitbit every year because they just stop working after this time. once had great customer service but now impossible to get hold off anyone, and they don’t respond even if you do get hold of someone. i will be switching to another brand this time round as there is just no support whatsoever, and not worth the money. i have had several fitbit's over the last number of years all of which eventually failed due to poor quality of product. latest a charge 4 ,out of warranty ,the screen detached .attempted to contact fitbit customer support to see if possible to repair ,have not even had courtesy of reply. much better and cheaper replacement from other companies. The latest update is awful. The sleep tracker is much much harder to read and i no longer get any text messages sent to my watch. i've restarted everything, uninstalled and reinstalled with no joy and no useful info from customer service or on the forums. i have contacted fitbit and have not even had an acknowledgement from them let alone response! not good. they also need to update their description and say this isn't waterproof! very poor customer service. if i could give zero stars i would! Final straw was discontinuing access to the web application. Now everything has to be done on the mobile app. Some people just don't like doing extensive work on their phone. This is a blatant money grab by google. shame on them! Product claims water resistance, but mine failed due to water damage. fitbit refused to replace this despite escalation and simply offered a paltry discount on buying another. terrible quality, poor company, buy something else. Good battery life, but now it’s linked to google, i do feel restricted. was given premium when i replaced broken fitbit. it is now due to expire and i am unable to cancel. spent forty minutes on phone. absolutely disgraceful when it should be as simple as pressing a button. i’ve had a fitbit for years but now totally sick of the customer support and always worrying it’s going to stop working for the price paid. all they do is offer you 30% of a new one. the more people that stop giving them their money the better! The strap does not hold properly in the water, even though they say is suitable for swimming. regarding the sense 2, the strap was falling off all the time and the screen crushed after falling down. i recommend to everyone looking for a fitness tracker to choose another brand. it is a pity as i liked the interface and the app. First watch had black screen issue after a few months, replacement was dead on arrival so another sent, now that replacement has same black screen issues. i don't even use it as anything but a watch and never wear during exercise. very poor and has longevity issues. will never buy another  broken within 6months was told a replacement would be sent out under warranty. replacement wasn't sent out customer service no help what so ever can't seem to get a answer from them. Long time fitbit user. upgraded to versa 4 and have had nothing but problems. inaccurate data, poor gps connectivity, and dismal customer/tech support. There are better trackers on the market. i don't know what has happened to fitbit, i have had fitbit's for years and they have been great, but recently their products quality has dropped to well below par. they have become rude and unhelpful. totally disregarding basic consumer rights. any drive for customer service has completely disappeared. i loved my fitbit luxe when i first had it and it worked perfectly. it’s not that old yet it now turns off randomly, twice today when i was exercising. it gives me completely random battery life percentages so i have no idea what the remaining battery life actually is. i won't be buying another one as i can’t rely on it which is a shame as i prefer the appearance of the fitbit. i have a 10 month old fitbit that the screen has suddenly stopped working on. i have followed up with another email asking for clarification as to why and had no response. the lifespan on the fitbit is getting steadily worse and i will not be replacing to a new one of this is the lifespan at the price they charge. i have spent hours trying to create an account . it wont let me fill in weight and height so cant create account. i have rung help line twice and been cut off twice. i will be returning this fit bit for a refund -unuseable. Support were very helpful to begin with however that has now all gone to pot. my fit bit died. i was advised that they could not ship a replacement to where i live so they would organise a credit within 4-6 weeks through payoneer. that time is now up and i have still not received the refund. i advised them of that and they were very unhelpful and told me to refer back to the email which i was sent to set up the pay oneer account however that link has been used so i can’t use it again. i messaged them back but they had closed my query and referred me back to start all over again with support!  fitbit charge 5 failed within just over a year and was replaced in february 24 - this one has stopped working - totally dead. would never buy another one  would never use another one. i am deeply disappointed with the quality and longevity of the watch i purchased from fitbit charge 5 for over £100. i am unwilling to spend another £100 on a product that clearly does not last. due to these ongoing issues and the unsatisfactory response from customer service, i cannot recommend fitbit to others. i hope my review helps others make an informed decision. i am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of fitbit products. we bought fitbit charge 4 and fitbit sense tracker watches. on two separate occasions, the bands broke on the fitbit Charge 4 and only one band was replaced on the warranty. the charging cable failed on the Fitbit sense, with specific reference to the charging Cable's vulnerable ""third pin"" which fails easily, even with careful use. Both my fitbits broke down after less than a year and won’t restart. can’s afford to replace my watch that often so very disappointed as when they work they’re good. My watch stopped working, black screen and tried the reset and wont work. support basically told me to trow it in the garbage...2 years, 200$!! they dont repaire the watches they produce and since it's not on warranty anymore theres nothing to do! they dont even have a solution if i want to pay to have it fixed! no reference for a certified tech or something. i am so disappointed, i'm gonna tell this story everywhere on sports blogs and review them, that is clear. i'm completely frustrated with the versa 3. love the technology but the product is crap. used fitbit for years on my 4th watch but its over. too many issues..customer services are hopeless... Don't waste your money there are cheaper and better tracker watches on the market. appalling service and quality , my watch stopped working they confirmed it was a manufacturers fault and refused to repair or replace it as it was only a matter of days out of warranty. i contacted fitbit customer service when my versa stopped working after getting splashed with water (it's supposed to be waterproof to a certain depth) customer service agent advised, after checking my details of purchase, that i was entitled to a full replacement and that i'd receive a follow up email with details on how to claim it. after this, i received an email saying they had made a mistake and instead was only entitled toA discount off a new device. very poor customer service to allow the mistake of an agent to affect the customer. they have since closed the case so i'm unable to contact them to escalate it to management. i have to restart my fitbit watch as it doesn’t read my heart rate. it vibrates at times to say it’s working. i’m on the look out for a device that actually works. i was very happy with the previous graphs! google changed the graphs for sleep such that they’re hard to interpret. i think google believes they had to change it up since they bought out fitbit. i’m going to an apple watch once i save up my money. The entire design team needs to be fired. the updates are awful!!!!  it's become so difficult to track the various measures i use. they have made everything harder to read and find. customers keep complaining and the company isn't listening. My fitbit failed in warranty.   they said they would replace it but all attempts to get that replacement have failed.  i believe this is a common occurrence. customer service not fit for purpose. The display of sleep data is not clear and is all overlapped so cant be read easily. The contrasting background vanished making things visually difficult. i tried going to leave feedback on the fitbit forum but there is nowhere to click to do so. i adore my fitbit for its versatility in tracking both running and swimming activities. i'm disheartened that the screen malfunctioned while i was swimming. despite reaching out to fitbit twice about my concerns, i've yet to receive any resolution. it's frustrating to find that a device marketed for swimming exercises has failed to meet expectations. i ordered my first fitbit from the fitbit website. instead of my fitbit i received an empty box. i raised this with the company and after a month of back and forth emails, i was told ""my case did not apply for a refund"". terrible customer service and have refused to offer me a refund. i haven't had a sleep score in a year. i am so frustrated and disappointed in their customer service and their product. i will be switching. unbelievable lousy product and customer service.my fitbit charge 5 (2 of them), nor my fitbit inspire will give me a sleep scored. i have been calling fitbit for a year, they replaced the charge 5, same thing. they want me to return my device and they will send me a 4th one. why would i keep doing the same thing that already does not work. i have been a strava user for years but this year there has been a problem with my subscription. they took two lots of money. the bank organised a refund for one of the amounts but this has resulted in me having no subscription showing on the app. emails to support bounce back and there appears to be no other way to contact them. i feel scammed by a main stream company and am looking for an alternative going forward. i’ve been a premium member for 8 years but has gone downhill so fast recently and their support is non-existent. my data is not displaying or being counted properly which makes it unusable. subscription reluctantly cancelled now. such a shame cos it used to be really good. perfect way to kill a company and lose your loyal customers. signed up years ago with an old email address which i no longer use / can’t access. my account’s still connected to facebook however (so can still login), so i wrote asking for help to change the address and nobody got back.cancelled my annual subscription now, which is a shame as i loved the ‘insights’ the app provides, but hate nothing more than bad service. i have used srava for years but for some time now it has recorded my activities twice and reporting each activity as two separate but somewhat different ones. i have tried followed the advice on clearing glitches but nothing seems to work. using the contact help option is a waste of time. it just searches a database to try to find similar problems, none of which have been relevant. garmin does record a multisport event as one with splits for the 5 segments so why can’t strava do the same given the feed is already done for them. love using strava, the data i get is good even if it has to come via a garmin. Free app was good for seeing my distances and stats on my and friends bike rides. Last few rides have all been a waste of time, the route shows straight lines through fields after a few kms so all the data is incorrect. it's put me off considering paying for the add on services. i tried the 3 months at 99p trial for their premium features and didn't find them very useful. unfortunately, i forgot to cancel the subscription meaning £49.99 was taken from my account. i quickly contacted customer services through their website where i was told to cancel and send details about how i subscribed within a few minutes. i sent these details and within a couple of hours i received a message from hans who had refunded the amount. i'm very happy with this service, especially during these trying times where i know many companies have longer wait times than usual. i don't use their route builder since the latest update but for a casual rider it's fine. however it's a shame that you can't import routes from gpx files, or push strava routes to garmin connect - it's only one way from garmin into strava. Started a half marathon this past weekend and attempting to start the timer, it never worked ... this was a  very frustrating way to begin a race, luckily i kept my nike app and it worked fine. Have been using app for runs lately involving tracking, distance and speed. Gifted a subscription to a friend, money was taken for it that same day. friend never received anything. one week later, and i’m still getting the ‘sorry to keep you waiting’ automated reply that others have reported below. my own subscription expires this month. i won’t be renewing. get your act together strava.  strava automatically took the £47.99. unfortunately i mistook this for a fraudulent transaction after several suspect/fake paypal emails. i queried this with paypal. strava have cancelled my subscription, so basically l have nothing to show for my money. as others have said, good app spoilt by greed. i want to delete my deceased husband's strava profile and account, but there is no way to get this done unless i join strava myself. i don't know what to do and it's been two and a half years and the guys he used to cycle with are very uncomfortable at this stage. i was over the moon with strava until today. they decided to remove all the bits i loved about the free app and ask you to now pay for it. they couldn't have picked a worse time , when all most people can do is try and exercise  more.   they should be encouraged you got it very wrong strava and i'm disappointed. i have been using the app for more than 4 years as a premium/summit member. The app is mostly great but after renewing summit and paying for 1 year i suddenly lost access to this service. have sent in help requests but so far no response after more than 5 days. terrible customer service.  strava has been my go-to cycling app so i recently signed up for the free trial with the intention of subscribing to the yearly plan. now suddenly the last two rides won't show up on my strava feed. i followed all of strava's troubleshooting to no avail. i need an app that is consistent and records all my rides. Strava app doesn't sync at all with a samsung watch. This is not a watch issue... issue is the strava app. loads of complaints from paying customers.... so they release an update.... which is no better!!! come on strava... first you take off things that we used to get free and expect us to now pay for them, yet you consistently release app updates full of bugs and issues!!!! cancelling membership. i use it to track my running, cycling, hiking. customer service is atrocious and non existent. signed up for free trial but ended up with a subscription but have never been able to log in and use the account. Great app when working, but truly awful customer support. i've spent 3 hours trying to resolve a simple subscription issue. do not expect any meaningful, useful, or personal support. very disappointing! miss have off my ride and day before stop for buy water and app still running ??? so every day rong data !!! you pay 70€ a year just to be fouled!!! transaction id81h15005y07165833 invoice id9f1ddc6fb7 $76.99 gone from my bank account .no reply to my many emails to company. i'm very disappointed with strava and their decision to charge for a number of functions that had been free in the past. Tried out the app once - did an eleven minute walk a month ago but the app cut off halfway through so i didn't use it again. tried to get a refund and cancelled the app within 30 minutes (after googling how to do it - they don't make it easy to find) google then declined my refund. so basically i just handed over my money for nothing. that is one weeks food shopping in my house. unbelievable. what sort of business does this? strava doesn't care. no-one cares. you can't speak to anyone. no humans. dreadful. This app has stopped recording runs, i paid for the full version and still continue to fail. terrible customer service, had the premium subscription as a gift, activated after a few month but it's buggy and doesn't work. lack of transparency in subscription/payments settings. pathetic hustle. The app and website are both riddled with bugs. Despite having notifications switched off for club posts/club events/etc - i still keep getting them. customer service couldn't help resolve it. i used to really like this app; not so much anymore. losing the ability to scan barcodes of food packages makes the app way less useful to me. i struggle with myfitnesspal on a regular basis, although i use it religiously. i really used to like it, but have become disappointed with all the movement towards a premium payment plan. i don't like that so much of the experience has been switch to premium. i also have a new fitness tracker (uses glory fit app) and fitness pal does not integrate with it. i understand money makes the world go round but that move was just greed. original users should have been grandfathered in for promoting the site. i've even made videos on how good this app was before they got all $$$$ hungry. Good access to a variety of foods and restaurant items. i do miss the barcode scanning feature in the non premium version. company has gone downhill since price locking what once were basic features. disappointed that the scan option isn't available anymore. i'm very disappointed in the end of newsfeed. it was such a great way to be an encouragement to my friends on the app on a daily basis. i know two of my friends have stopped using the app because they were heartbroken over the loss of this support.  used my fitness pal for years on and off…just logged back on and the dashboard has changed and now no bar scanner.what was a great app has been deleted not even worth paying, as it’s not user friendly anymore at all."

An expensive bit of kit, which has been reliable for the two years i have owned it. my really big concern is having spent a lot of money on its initial purchase to really benefit you have to then pay to use all the functions within the app. knowing what i know now in no way, shape or form would buy another fitbit. realistically at its purchase the complete and full app should come with it all included. i don’t get fooled twice and i hope none of you out there get fooled once. i’m writing this regarding a versa 4 my wife bought for me as a christmas gift in december 2022. this watch recently died and could not be reset, less than 6 months after warranty ended. fitbit support offered a 35% discount on a new one instead of replacing it.  don't buy this product or do so at your own risk.  fitbit charge5 stopped syncing with the mobile app 12apr 2024. i bought it in april 2023. i tried all the steps available online and on the fitbit community forum. nothing worked. 16 apr 2024 - i had a live chat with fitbit onine. They were helpful and my fitbit is nowsyncing with mobile app. i was totally unaware they could do this, would not refund payment. be very careful if you use their app. it keeps you healthy  you help me stay on track, easy to use. if yiy switch phone they won't honor it they blame it on apple very dissatisfied customer."

Please submit your best shots of New York for next week. Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of snapshots. Two watches (charge 4 and 5) died right after one year of normal wear, not even exercising, or in the shower. all they offer was 35% off. doesn't even offer servicing like apple does. customer service is utterly useless and does not treat you as a human being. waste of money. i like it but unfortunately it never picks up the stairs even if i'm walking up 8 floors. charge 4 lasted 2 year, the plastic connection bit on the side of the fitbit that clips onto your strap snapped off. charge 2 stopped working after 2 year also. i have a fitbit versa 3. it is literally the worst health and lifestyle watch in the history of mankind. the versa 3 loses gps signal in the countryside, in built up areas, in residential areas, basically everywhere. it then uses some ridiculous algorithm to work out what you've done whilst the signal was lost. pathetic. do not buy. Tried to return the fitbit as under warranty involves printing off a trees worth of paper in consignment notes etc. You have to go on hold to the courier company selected by google within australia. Nearly an hour later someone picks up and agrees you can’t do this online and they book you a pick up slot. However that window at your home address is between 9am and 5pm and you have to be home as they won't just pick it up. i see myself and many others have their fitbit account hacked. some of the responses on their helpcenter goes to say that the customer read the email wrong which is kind of funny. i recommend a garmin watch, their software is also very good and can link up to other third party apps. Customer service is a joke. never ending runaround just to get a replacement for a defective versa 3. shambles of a device. didn't last 18 months and they expect me to buy a new one at 35% discount. absolute joke. don't buy these products, they aren't made to last. Had a charge 4 and it performed pretty well apart from it not linking up with my phone after a period and then the bit that attached to the strap snapped and it was no longer usable. Was still in warranty but to try and contact fitbit to replace the product is a joke. i won't be buying a fitbit again. i can no longer scan a barcode on, say, a loaf of bread without signing up for their premium service. what a joke! i won't be using this app again. so long, mFP!"
