While this is not always easy, asking if the at-risk person has a plan and removing or disabling the lethal means can make a difference.\n3. **BE THERE:** Listen carefully and learn what the individual is thinking and feeling. Research suggests [acknowledging and talking about suicide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15811983) may in fact [reduce rather than increase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24998511) suicidal thoughts.\n4. **HELP THEM CONNECT:** Save the 988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline number **(call or text 988)** and the Crisis Text Line number **(741741)** in your phone so they’re there if you need them. You can also help make a connection with a trusted individual like a family member, friend, spiritual advisor, or mental health professional.\n5. **STAY CONNECTED:** Staying in touch after a crisis or after being discharged from care can make a difference. [Studies have shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11376235) the number of suicide deaths goes down when someone follows up with the at-risk person.\n\nThe things that I want to comment here are that if you think someone you care about is having thoughts of suicide the most important thing is to be physically there for them and getting them to a mental health professional/emergency department. Often people will avoid having difficult conversations such as “Do you have thoughts of suicide?” for fear of making things worse/making this person uncomfortable. Being direct and talking openly about your concerns for this person is the best way to approach them.\xa0\n\nIf anyone needs to talk to someone I'm always here as are a lot of individuals in this community.

2nd time posting here, posted about a year or so ago. 33 year old dad of two boys seeking some help. Trying to drop body fat and weight. I estimate myself around 175 and 25% body fat, target goal is 12% body fat, which I estimate I'd need to get around 155 lbs for.

Currently working with a trainer for the last 5 months who provides nutrition guidance and weight training feedback. Target calorie goal is 1800 kcal/day. Average steps are 20k/day. I do a 4x/week program( 2x upper, 2x lower.) 

Over the last 6 months, just haven't made much progress. Still hover between 172-175. Clothes fit slightly better; but don't notice much difference outside of that. I'm pretty disciplined about logging food and even taking pics. Not blaming my trainer, as I think it's me. Just can't seem to get past this barrier. 

Don't wanna cut calories further and truthfully, short of walking around every minute of every day, going to be tough to get more steps in. Just trying to get leaner and in need of some help. Even considering Ozempic, as much as I don't want to. Just really wanna get to this weight; but it's a huge mental and physical struggle for me right now.

Hey everyone, I could really use some advice. I’m trying to get back into shape, but I’m hitting a major roadblock with squats.

I haven’t been in great shape  for a while. About 10 years ago, I was doing the 5x5 routine, going to the gym regularly, and that’s the best I’ve ever looked. But now, life’s a bit different—I’ve got three young kids, and time is tight. I’ve been inspired by this sub to get fit again, and I’m trying to make the most of my home gym. I’ve got a squat rack, a box, and a bench with leg press capability.

Here’s the problem: I can’t do my old go-to, the back squat, anymore. When I load the bar on my back, it feels like my shoulder and back muscles are getting pinched, and they start to spasm. Plus, I can only squat about 25% of the way down before I’m stuck. I’m really struggling to figure out how to work around this. I can get all the way down with a body weight squat but I have massive lean forwards. 

My main goal right now is to lose about 20 lbs—I’m doing intermittent fasting (IF) and aiming to mix weights with some HIIT. But I need some tips on how to modify my routine or find alternatives to get back on track, especially with squats being out of the picture for now.

&lt;p&gt;I have a fairly consistent diet that includes a homemade egg breakfast sandwich that I take to work. All I did was cut out the bread and butter/cream cheese and ate the eggs with steamed vegetables like broccoli instead -- everything else in my diet, I kept the same.&lt;/p&gt;

,fitness30plus,"Hey friends! 

I’m 34F 5’4” and have been on my weightlifting journey for about 3 months solid now, going to the gym 3x a week. I had to start physical therapy for some knee issues but I’ve been progressing great with that and have decided to see how I like training for powerlifting. I really enjoy deadlifts and just started learning bench presses and squatting the bar (idk the official term sorry!!). I work out with a trainer 2x a week and have my own routine for the weekends. Needless to say, I’m really digging this and love how it’s really changed my eating habits and health (my dad passed from a heart attack and it really messed me up so I really wanted to make a change for myself and my 3 year old.

Anyway, my mom is almost 70 and started seeing the same trainer and going to my gym as well. My trainer recently confided in me that my mom told him (a former body builder and powerlifter) that she didn’t want me to continue training because I “was going to look like a man”. I brushed it off because this hasn’t been the first time she’s said something like this but it’s really discouraging and hurts to hear coming from a parent. I have pink hair, I do my makeup for the gym, I wear lashes, I do my nails, I love to do all the girly stuff and I love to lift as well. I’ve never had anyone make a comment like this before and I feel like it’s set my confidence back some. I still want to work hard but that’s all I hear now in the back of my head. She doesn’t know I know and I know she probably doesn’t understand how much it hurts me.

,fitness30plus,"Hi, I am 33M. I am a reasonably fit person and I have been weight training for the past 16+ years.

I have always had a bad right shoulder and have shown it to multiple physios. Recently I had a really painful AC joint and I showed it to one physio. He gave me an ultrasound and vibration/shockwave therapy. The pain was reduced, but I did not feel 100% fit even after a month. One of my friends works with Olympians and he referred me to a proper sports physio. He was really good and examined me properly. According to him, I have many trigger points along my rhomboid muscles and I have a tight neck. He gave me a lot of cross-friction massage and gave me multiple exercises. According to him, this could have been causing an increased load on my AC joint. He suggested I get a neck X-ray done as well.

I got the X-ray done and found out that there were mild signs of cervical spondylitis(C4-C5-C6). 

Just wanted to know from the forum if this change is reversible. How severe is this?

Has anyone gone through this? What measure does one have to take? TIA!

I would cut weight to fight when I was younger but never got aesthetics.

Started my cut 8 weeks ago at 5’10 240lbs and I am now 223lbs.

4 days a week on the weights, no additional cardio as of now.

Just did the 3 site caliper test for readings of :

Chest 8mm
Abdomen 16mm
Quad/thigh 8mm.

According to Jackson pollock formula I’m at 10% body fat.


This does not add up as I still do not have visible abs, there’s still soft fat tissue on my back although a huge decrease in the love handles area.

I was raised in the Kate Moss days. It’s a constant struggle to not say, no just be really skinny and don’t eat.&lt;/p&gt;

While my gluteal hypertrophy may not qualify as big, I certainly can not lie.

I was warming up today as usual, going through my [Olde Man Warm-up](https://youtu.be/CdR4PArbxuA).  Reflecting that, among the main six compounds, squat is probably the first I'll stop trying to progress.  I said progress - there's [value](https://youtu.be/xc0CKNT4vM4) in my warm-up alone.  Whatever the Minimum Value For Health is, napsquatting one plate is above it. 

It's a warm-up.  A warm-up should be mentally easy.  It greases the groove, making work sets easier.  I hit my last warm-up set, [a single at two plates](https://youtu.be/sBbW2V-I5vs).  A mark I hit years ago grinding Starting Strength.  The difference now is, obviously, *there is no question about my depth*.  Even if I never squat above 2 plates again, I have that parlor trick unlocked.  And to rephrase the obvious:

Squatting two plates is overkill for Basic Minimum Health.  Those of you scared of the rack *seriously* never need to squat this much to see *some* benefit.

So, I load the bar with 235 lbs, as per my log.  3x3 @ 235 lbs, followed by 2x9 @ 175 lbs.  That's what I wrote down.

Man, videos [make it look easier](https://youtu.be/NKf-HbZ8RLU) than it felt.  Two hundred thirty-five.  I'd get laughed out of any powerlifting gym.  Your average bloke probably thinks I'm insane for doing it at all.  *I'm impressing nobody.* 

Those that know, know:  the second downset [felt easier than the first](https://youtu.be/wa6NqV4ZvY0).  I think of the guys lamenting they want their grandkids to look up to them.  Kids don't care about quads, they care about piggyback rides.  A bodyweight load is more than sufficient training for piggyback rides.  Except.  I don't have any progeny.  I have nothing of the sort like that to look forward to.

Yup, sometimes you're Rocky Balboa, [sometimes you're Ivan Drago](https://youtu.be/qHS_ntIvY4M).

It's the [stuff in the basement](https://youtu.be/d3U_U_T5CRU).  I don't know what else to call it.  My 30s weren't kind to me.  I hit 30, and life decided to start chew me up and spit me out.  For long periods, I just stopped trying.  Unfortunately, whether it's mind or body, *it takes a long goddamned amount of time to die*.  Tried to kill myself, and unfortunately lived.  Been trying to get year to year consistency since 2020.  Didn't lift at all last year.

I'm stuck here.  Living.  It's not so much [get busy living or get busy dying](https://youtu.be/46GwJbrMghQ).  It's that *I'm stuck living*, and holy hell it takes a long time to die.  ...So might as well try living.  I don't have much of a choice.

I stared at the squat rack, as I do a lot.  As per my [favorite tattoo](https://www.instagram.com/p/C-NQZ80OcXv/), I thought of Captain James T. Kirk.

Why did Kirk climb a mountain?  [Because it's there](https://youtu.be/NRYz5nKDTuE).  That's it.  That sentiment is why I squat.  I squat *because I can*.  Two good knees, bulletproof back, mobile hips.  If you want to move a couch, I'm your twunk.

Later, Kirk talks about how he doesn't want his pain taken away, he needs his pain.  Whatever drives Captain Kirk, [he doesn't want it taken away](https://youtu.be/WLzJAebfEIg). Whatever is keeping me going, I don't need to understand it to know it's there.

Whatever stuff in the basement I have, whatever in me that somehow refuses to die.  Yeah, that.  That's why I squat.  Maybe you know your reason, maybe you haven't understood it yet.

*""An unexamined life is not worth living."" - Socrates*

I don't exactly look forward to squatting, but every time I'm done, I certainly know I'm still alive.  I squat because I'm still here.

I hit my last warm-up set, &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/sBbW2V-I5vs""&gt;a single at two plates&lt;/a&gt;.  A mark I hit years ago grinding Starting Strength.  The difference now is, obviously, &lt;em&gt;there is no question about my depth&lt;/em&gt;.  Even if I never squat above 2 plates again, I have that parlor trick unlocked.  And to rephrase the obvious:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squatting two plates is overkill for Basic Minimum Health.  Those of you scared of the rack &lt;em&gt;seriously&lt;/em&gt; never need to squat this much to see &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I load the bar with 235 lbs, as per my log.  3x3 @ 235 lbs, followed by 2x9 @ 175 lbs.  That&amp;#39;s what I wrote down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, videos &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/NKf-HbZ8RLU""&gt;make it look easier&lt;/a&gt; than it felt.  Two hundred thirty-five.  I&amp;#39;d get laughed out of any powerlifting gym.  Your average bloke probably thinks I&amp;#39;m insane for doing it at all.  &lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m impressing nobody.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those that know, know:  the second downset &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/wa6NqV4ZvY0""&gt;felt easier than the first&lt;/a&gt;.  I think of the guys lamenting they want their grandkids to look up to them.  Kids don&amp;#39;t care about quads, they care about piggyback rides.  A bodyweight load is more than sufficient training for piggyback rides.  Except.  I don&amp;#39;t have any progeny.  I have nothing of the sort like that to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup, sometimes you&amp;#39;re Rocky Balboa, &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/qHS_ntIvY4M""&gt;sometimes you&amp;#39;re Ivan Drago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/d3U_U_T5CRU""&gt;stuff in the basement&lt;/a&gt;.  I don&amp;#39;t know what else to call it.  My 30s weren&amp;#39;t kind to me.  I hit 30, and life decided to start chew me up and spit me out.  For long periods, I just stopped trying.  Unfortunately, whether it&amp;#39;s mind or body, &lt;em&gt;it takes a long goddamned amount of time to die&lt;/em&gt;.  Tried to kill myself, and unfortunately lived.  Been trying to get year to year consistency since 2020.  Didn&amp;#39;t lift at all last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m stuck here.  Living.  It&amp;#39;s not so much &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/46GwJbrMghQ""&gt;get busy living or get busy dying&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;#39;s that &lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m stuck living&lt;/em&gt;, and holy hell it takes a long time to die.  ...So might as well try living.  I don&amp;#39;t have much of a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stared at the squat rack, as I do a lot.  As per my &lt;a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/C-NQZ80OcXv/""&gt;favorite tattoo&lt;/a&gt;, I thought of Captain James T. Kirk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did Kirk climb a mountain?  &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/NRYz5nKDTuE""&gt;Because it&amp;#39;s there&lt;/a&gt;.  That&amp;#39;s it.  That sentiment is why I squat.  I squat &lt;em&gt;because I can&lt;/em&gt;.  Two good knees, bulletproof back, mobile hips.  If you want to move a couch, I&amp;#39;m your twunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, Kirk talks about how he doesn&amp;#39;t want his pain taken away, he needs his pain.  Whatever drives Captain Kirk, &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/WLzJAebfEIg""&gt;he doesn&amp;#39;t want it taken away&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever is keeping me going, I don&amp;#39;t need to understand it to know it&amp;#39;s there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever stuff in the basement I have, whatever in me that somehow refuses to die.  Yeah, that.  That&amp;#39;s why I squat.  Maybe you know your reason, maybe you haven&amp;#39;t understood it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;An unexamined life is not worth living.&amp;quot; - Socrates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t exactly look forward to squatting, but every time I&amp;#39;m done, I certainly know I&amp;#39;m still alive.  I squat because I&amp;#39;m still here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who hate reading and need to be spoonfed:  aesthetics, functionality, and heart.  That&amp;#39;s why I squat.&lt;/p&gt;

I have Core Fitness 50 lb adjustable dumbbells and loadable olympic handles.  
I have done  doing Carolin Girvan  Iron program  few times, and lift 4 but am kind of getting to point where I can do a LOT of reps at 50 lbs.  Or wven going heavier with my Loadables. 

Fairly  limited on space currently. trying to decide if I should get something like 90lb powerblocks or a ""shorty"" Olympic bar or EZ bar.  Also want to get an  adjustable bench (got my eye on a couple that can store upright)

Concerns with getting powerblocks  is my hands are getting tired when trying to do sumo or suitcase squats with heavy olympic handles (which are kind of unwieldy, but powerblocks would at least be fast weight change)

Trying to decide if ezbar would be a good progression or if a 5 or 6 ft Olympic style bar would be better. 

Not looking to compete or body build just age well and keep strength, lose some pudge etc. 

Just trying to brainstorm here.  Would consider squat stands that could be put in a corner when not actively is use. (Holding off on a folding wall rack until garage cleaned out and prepped etc which is liable to be awhile)

,fitness30plus,"I recently started getting back into fitness. Before covid, I was actively in the gym 5x a week, however, after that I simply stopped going. My goal is to get my weight back down to 88kg when I was close to my peak, or looking back at my pictures I felt that way at least. After hitting 105kg, and starting to get winded just walking up 2 flights of stairs, I signed myself back up for the gym at the beginning of this year and mainly focused on cardio, going 2-3x a week. During the first half of this year, my weight came down to 102, but stuck around there. Other than that small change, I did notice most of my breathing issues and inflammation went away.  A positive sign, but still not enough. 

Well, 2.5 weeks ago, I started dieting fairly stringently using the Lose It app. I put in a plan for having 1500-1700 calories a day, which would equate to roughly 1kg loss per week. If I worked out and made it over a specific threshold of calories expended, the app would allow for some additional caloric intake. This would happen most gym days as I would primarily do 1 hour on the stair mill burning 900-1000 calories on it. Well, 2 weeks pass, and I came down to \~99kg, which I was extremely pleased with. Just knowing myself, I decided to sign up for a trainer to hold myself accountable this time.

His guidance to me, has been I should be having 2200-2500 calories, and really focus on strength training rather than all the cardio I was doing. This sort of confounded me as having more calories, and building muscle seemed to be at odds with the small wins from the prior weeks. Although my muscles are aching from being in recovery now, I tipped back up to 101kg this morning. I know part of this is my body trying to adjust and get everything in balance with what I'm pushing it through, but I'm curious how others here have balanced strength training, cardio, and diet. Honestly, seeing the number cross 100kg was demotivating. I don't want to put my body in shock by starving it, but mentally, I really want the fat to go and the body weight to come back down. I realize losing fat while maintain/building muscle is hard to do, and will take months, so any suggestions, advice, or personal experience would be appreciated.  Thanks!

I read through some old posts and the general consensus is that timing of your protein doesn’t matter as much as amount. That still generally agreed upon? Because whey makes me DEEPLY tired about 30min after taking it these days. I’m taking lying on my couch waiting for my ADHD meds to win the fight stronger. This is not sustainable for me. 

My big question though is if timing doesn’t matter,  should I switch to a slow digesting protein like casein? I would be taking it before bed going forward. 

I don’t have any experience with casein. Back before kids in my semi-athletic days (college rugby hooker/gaslit myself into running) I only used whey. 

Extra info for what it’s worth-

I get up at 0500 daily to work out as it’s the only time I have before kiddos are awake. 

Focusing on building back muscle. Cutting would be nice, but is not my current focus. Lean bulk? A good maintainable balance while I get back into things.

,fitness30plus,"M, late 30s, 5’10”, 175 lb. 

My entire adult life I hovered around 165 lb. Ate super healthy, lifted and worked out a lot. 1-2 cheat meals a week.

We have a toddler, and also I have a new job that is much higher pay but requires 1-2 nice work dinners a week where we basically order a bunch of appetizers and entrees and eat family style. 

With this, I have lost all self discipline. I still make time to work out 3-4 times a week (lift, swim, Peloton), but since the toddler and new job, I just eat terribly now.  I eat horrible at the work dinners, which would be OK if I had self control at home, but I don’t. I try to count calories, typically do well at breakfast/lunch, but I overeat at dinner, snack a lot, eat my toddler’s leftovers, and can’t control my impulses. 

I keep telling myself “Oh this is a tough week. I had these dinners, or this family was in town visiting, or we had these events.” But really, there is always some excuse every week for why I ate poorly. Every morning I tell myself I’ll be better and by night I can’t control it. And I keep slowly gaining weight.

,fitness30plus,"Hey everyone,

I’m a 35-year-old guy who spent most of my teenage years and early 20s overweight. I’ve always been a big guy—6'2"" with broad shoulders—but things got really bad when I started working full-time, and my weight ballooned to over 130 kg. 

About 10 years ago, I managed to lose around 25-30 kg, but since then, I've been oscillating between 110-120 kg. Although I've continued lifting, my diet has never been clean enough to lose a significant amount of body fat.

At the start of this year, I weighed 115 kg and set a goal to lose 15-20 kg of body fat while also improving my cardiovascular endurance and physical strength. I’ve always been an avid lifter, but with two boys under the age of 3, there was a 2-year hiatus from lifting.

Currently, I’m down about 6-7 kg, which isn’t as much as I’d hoped, but with two little ones, I’ve accepted it as a realistic outcome. For my cardio and strength goals, I wanted to run a 10k in under an hour while maintaining a deadlift of more than 2x my body weight and a squat close to 2x my body weight.

I’m happy to say that I’ve achieved and am maintaining my cardio and lifting goals, but the fat loss still feels daunting and far away. I naively thought that getting stronger and improving my cardio would make the fat melt away, as if everything would work linearly. It’s been quite disheartening, to be honest.

,fitness30plus,"I am 32 years old and over the past 4 years, I have lost around 92 lbs (252-160.6) When I started my cut recently I wanted to focus and get the leanest I have ever been. In May I decided to hire a nutrition coach and let him give me the plan and routine to focus on during my cut. This was probably the best decision I have ever made. Not only did it make it super easy, I feel the healthiest I have ever been. 

My daily calorie intake is around 2200 calories. I started my cut at 176 and had been out of the gym consistently for 2 months. My plan included having a protein shake first thing at 6:30 AM, Breakfast at 11:00 AM, Lunch at 3:00 PM, Dinner at 7:00 PM, and a late-night snack at 8:00/8:30 PM.  In bed by 9:30/10:00 to ensure I was getting my 7-8 hours of sleep.

My fitness routine became waking up every morning at 5:15 AM and going on a 2-4 mile walk with my dog wearing my 20lb, 5.11 tactical plate carrier vest. Tried to maintain a pace of 14:30 miles while on my walks. This was done 6-7 days a week. After work, I would go to the gym in the evenings doing a Bro Split 5 days a week. I do track all my calories from my workouts but I use those to determine how hard I have gone in a workout vs using it as an actual count. Calorie trackers like an Apple watch aren't very accurate but they can help show you trends over time.

During this cut, I was able to regain all my strength from being out of the gym for a few months and start making progress in my workouts. I ended my 3-month plan with my coach down 14.2 lbs at 161.8 and the leanest I have ever been. This is the lowest weight I have been since 7th grade. Post plan I have cut another 1.2 lbs and counting.

The current goal is to continue to cut to possibly 155 and then this fall do a lean bulk to 170/175 and do another cut in the spring to get ready for Summer 2025.

In May I decided to hire a nutrition coach and let him give me the plan and routine to focus on during my cut. This was probably the best decision I have ever made. Not only did it make it super easy, I feel the healthiest I have ever been. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daily calorie intake is around 2200 calories. I started my cut at 176 and had been out of the gym consistently for 2 months. My plan included having a protein shake first thing at 6:30 AM, Breakfast at 11:00 AM, Lunch at 3:00 PM, Dinner at 7:00 PM, and a late-night snack at 8:00/8:30 PM.  In bed by 9:30/10:00 to ensure I was getting my 7-8 hours of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fitness routine became waking up every morning at 5:15 AM and going on a 2-4 mile walk with my dog wearing my 20lb, 5.11 tactical plate carrier vest. Tried to maintain a pace of 14:30 miles while on my walks. This was done 6-7 days a week. After work, I would go to the gym in the evenings doing a Bro Split 5 days a week.

Something I've been working on this year is trying to work on consistency of effort. I've had to have a bit of a hard talk with myself to figure out why some of my muscle groups have been growing really well - back, quads, arms - but others have been really disappointing - chest and shoulders especially. It's getting to the point where I'm growing a gorilla back but a DYEL chest. 

I thought I had been training pretty hard and consistently, so I thought at first it was maybe just how my genetics worked. Maybe it is, but I think the answer is more simple. I'm good at deadlifts and I enjoy them. I go all out on my rowing exercises. Meanwhile, I suck at pressing movements and I don't enjoy them. I half-ass my lateral raises. I probably just try and get through the reps more than I actually apply my best work. 

Seems likely in my case that my genetics are not the issue and my effort is simply misapplied in some cases. So I have the perception of ""yeah, I've been training hard"", but also having to admit that consistently across certain movements I've been phoning it in.  

The irony here is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Maybe instead if I attacked my pressing movements with dedication and intensity I might actually get good at them and enjoy them.

Leaner than my previous 210-212 look. This past bulk was a huge success and it honestly didn’t take too much time. Maybe 2-3 months then maintenance got a few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently had a big casting and needed to cut a bit for that. If I get the gig I will probably head down towards 205. Hopefully that’ll take away the lower back fat. Last time I lost the low back fat I was in the 190’s a few years ago. I think I’ve made a ton of progress recently and just wanted to share. Very proud of this package I’ve been putting together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep killing your workouts friends. It’s all about consistency and patience. ❤️ &lt;/p&gt;

I began working with a personal trainer 8 weeks ago and had my 8 week assessment. When I started with the gym I weighed in at 107 pounds (was 95 - I am only 5 feet tall). I was concerned because I felt like I was gaining fat, not muscle. When they took today’s measurements my legs were the same, but my mid section actually got smaller and biceps increased. However when I look in the mirror, I don’t see it. I have never trained before, just did cardio to lose weight and dieted and remained in calorie deficit. I weighed in today at 114, BMI 20% lean muscle up to I think 84-89%?  My question is, is this normal to feel fat even when the numbers say otherwise?

,fitness30plus,"Hey r/fitness30plus community, 

I created a functional fitness exercise database in Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets for strength training – it’s a free resource to help keep all of your strength training exercises organized and quickly accessed in an easy-to-use spreadsheet for your workouts (https://www.reddit.com/r/personaltraining/s/cvI4jUYMcv). I am constantly updating the exercise database each month with new equipment, exercises, and search filters - so I wanted to share a quick summary of the additions to the database for August. 

The highlight of this update is adding the tire as a primary equipment item, 43 new calf raise variations (standing, seated, split squat isometric) and adding “shins” to “target muscle group” and its associated tibialis raise exercises. A full breakdown of all of the updates in version 1.9 is listed below, as well as the download link to get your updated copy of the database.

More about the exercise database:

It is time consuming to sift through all the exercise information available on the internet (multiple exercise databases, YouTube videos, fitness pages/social media), so I made this to have all of the data in one spreadsheet that can be quickly filtered for your exercise search. The database has more than 25 search filters available for over 2000 + functional exercises - allowing you to find the information you need in seconds when designing fitness programs or learning new movement patterns. 

The fitness library also includes exercises using the barbell, dumbbells, kettlebells, gymnastics rings, parallette bars, calisthenics, clubbells, indian clubs, maces, the bulgarian bag, the heavy sandbag, the tire, the landmine attachment, suspension trainer, sliders and other functional equipment that you may not have used for your current workouts. All exercises requiring you to move, stabilize, and develop functional and pain free strength.

In this version 1.9 update, I have added the following to the exercise database:

-	Added “Tire” as a new “Primary Equipment” item.
-	Added “Shins” as a new “Target Muscle Group” item.
-	Added 43 new calf raise variations (standing, seated, split squat isometric) to target soleus or gastrocnemius.
-	Added 39 new slider reverse lunge variations.
-	Added 24 new bodyweight exercises.
-	Added 22 new tire exercises.
-	Added 21 new kettlebell exercises.
-	Added 18 new dumbbell exercises.
-	Added 15 new clubbell exercises.
-	Added 14 new ez bar exercises.
-	Added 12 new dumbbell bicep curl variations.
-	Added 10 new skull crusher variations.
-	Added 9 new barbell olympic weightlifting exercises.
-	Added 6 new carry variations.
-	Added 5 new tibialis raise variations.
-	Added 3 new macebell exercises.
-	Added 15 additional new miscellaneous exercises.
-	Added 11 missing video demonstrations for kettlebell lunge variations
-	Added 3 missing video demonstrations for the heavy sandbag
-	Added “None” for blank entries under “Secondary Equipment”
-	Added missing “Bench” items under “Secondary Equipment” for seated exercises and hip thrust variations
-	Changed exercise name “Box Step Up to Single Leg Balance” to “Box Russian Step Up”
-	Changed “Half Knee Hover” posture to “Split Squat Isometric”. Seems to be a more standardized description for the position.
-	Changed “Adductor Slide” to “Slider Lateral Lunge” for consistency with rest of database.
-	Switched a number of “Video Demonstration” videos that are better suited as “Video Explanation” videos. Going to keep video demonstrations as non-verbal and just a quick snapshot of the movement pattern. 
-	Replaced various broken “Video Demonstration” links. 
-	Corrected “Skater Squat” variations posture to “Single Leg Standing”.

,fitness30plus,"Hey guys, sorry if the title is weird and/or not clear.

I was 160kg 10 years ago. I lost 50 kg in a span of 2 years following a low fat diet and going to the gym doing weight lifting. Fast forward 10 years. I am still weight training. However I gained some of that weight back. I am a lot more muscular than before though.

I currently go to gym 2,3 times a week and do mostly compound movements (5x5 and SS stuff) and some light cardio. Sadly I'm currently very sedentary due to having a newborn.

My focus is to lose the weight and lower the fat %, have a good amount of muscle and improve my conditioning. 

My question is: Is there some sport or type of training that I could do, that is inline with my targets, and that being on a high fat percentage is an advantage? If not, what would you suggest me to do?

,fitness30plus,"So I'll get the PR thing out of the way first, and it's not a huge PR, especially by interwebs standards.  I deadlifted 315 lbs. last night.  I probably should've been able to do that a while back as a 200 lb guy, but I'm kinda lanky at 6'2 and my legs are super long with not much mass like a killdeer (it's a bird that doesn't actually kill deer...I don't think - I know they can't kill a deer with their legs).  I'm sort of upper body dominant.  I benched 2 plates probably two years ago, but a 3 plate deadlift - just did that last night.

Here's the part that I don't understand.  I haven't trained deadlifts or even done RDL's in probably two months.  I've been doing my own upper lower split lately, and for legs, I've been squatting, doing leg extensions and leg curls on a janky weight bench attachment I got for free, and doing calf raises.  The last time I deadlifted prior, I did 295 and I couldn't get 315 up past a few inches from the ground.  Just wasn't happening.  Last night, I did 135 X 5, 225 X 3, 275 X 1, and then 295 X 1.  The 295 was fairly easy, so I figured what the heck.  315 went up pretty quickly and easily.  The only thing that seemed like it might fail was my grip.

So I wonder what's up with that?  Did the leg curls help?  Was it all in my head?  Did taking a break from the deadlift....help my deadlift?  Maybe I was overtraining earlier?

I deadlifted 315 lbs. last night.  I probably should&amp;#39;ve been able to do that a while back as a 200 lb guy, but I&amp;#39;m kinda lanky at 6&amp;#39;2 and my legs are super long with not much mass like a killdeer (it&amp;#39;s a bird that doesn&amp;#39;t actually kill deer...I don&amp;#39;t think - I know they can&amp;#39;t kill a deer with their legs).  I&amp;#39;m sort of upper body dominant.  I benched 2 plates probably two years ago, but a 3 plate deadlift - just did that last night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the part that I don&amp;#39;t understand.  I haven&amp;#39;t trained deadlifts or even done RDL&amp;#39;s in probably two months.  I&amp;#39;ve been doing my own upper lower split lately, and for legs, I&amp;#39;ve been squatting, doing leg extensions and leg curls on a janky weight bench attachment I got for free, and doing calf raises.  The last time I deadlifted prior, I did 295 and I couldn&amp;#39;t get 315 up past a few inches from the ground.  Just wasn&amp;#39;t happening.  Last night, I did 135 X 5, 225 X 3, 275 X 1, and then 295 X 1.  The 295 was fairly easy, so I figured what the heck.  315 went up pretty quickly and easily.  The only thing that seemed like it might fail was my grip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I wonder what&amp;#39;s up with that?  Did the leg curls help?  Was it all in my head?  Did taking a break from the deadlift....help my deadlift?  Maybe I was overtraining earlier?  I wouldn&amp;#39;t think I was overtraining (was loosely following Starting Strength programming for squat and DL only there for a while), but I will be 50 in September so...maybe I can&amp;#39;t handle a ton of volume.

I need to get some direction to help my parents (Mom 56, Dad 63) ease into strength training.   
  
They’ve been consistent with cardio their whole lives—mostly early morning walks. A while back, they switched it up a bit: Dad now swims 3 days a week (which he loves), while Mom does yoga and jump rope on those same days. On the other 3 days, they go for their usual morning walks together, and Mom skips the yoga and jump rope.

They’ve shown interest in adding strength training to their routine, and I’ve started them off with some basic bodyweight exercises and resistance band workouts. Now we'd like to introduce weights but am unsure whether to go with kettlebells or dumbbells (considering 2kg/4lbs and 5kg/11lbs options).

,fitness30plus,"Now I know in principle it's exactly the same game. You just need to eat less than you burn. You adjust what you eat if the needle isn't moving. Maybe you move around more. Same principle. Simple in theory. 

But man, the actual *execution* of it definitely takes way more deliberate and focused attention now. What was I doing when I was 21? Working in a car wash for 8 hours a day in the sun. Skipping meals because I was broke. Going entire days on a single burrito.  Drinking Corona and getting drunk off 4 of them.  Any extra lbs probably just helped me look better. 

What does life look like now? Let's use step counting as a proxy. I drive to and from work, I sit in an office chair all day.  If I don't go out of my way to do some cardio then in I'll probably walk less than 2000 steps a day. Lifting weights hardly changes things at all, that step counter gets up to maybe 4000 on a regular gym day. Getting my total activity up to a more reasonable weekly level means deliberately saying ""No"" to various other things I want to do, every day. That's an hour walking when I could be doing countless other things. 

And then food. I have money to buy food whenever I want now.  Even if I don't snack and I just have two ""regular"" meals a day (regular meaning: portions I'm used to), I'm coasting by at maintenance weight. My taste for beer only grew in richness and volume. It's not 4 light beers if I want to get drunk now, it's a 3 pints of wheat bear and a bottle of wine. Every goddamn day in the office it's someone's birthday and there's cake. And now because I lift I have to make sure I still get a lot of protein in while keeping calories low. When I was 21 I didn't care about cooking. Now my soul cries if I'm not pouring olive oil on things. 

All this to say, it's a little frustrating trying to lose weight and knowing in principle what you're supposed to do, but facing the reality of 1) no snacks, 2) two smaller meals, 3) cutting most alcohol, 4) doing a bunch of low intensity cardio activity you know in your heart of hearts is not even in the top 5 things you would rather do.

,fitness30plus,"*background* So I'm (32f) at the 1 year mark with my trainer. I meet with them twice a week for 30 minutes. I know it's not much but it's what I can consistently manage as I'm a mom with a toddler. I'm proud of myself for making it a whole year without stopping as my longest consistent stint before that was 3 months before covid shut down the gyms.

I just had my body composition scan and it showed I have lost about 5% of fat while putting on about 6lbs of muscle over the past year. All things considered (mainly that I only workout an hour a week) I think the progress isn't bad and yet I still feel like I haven't made much progress at all. I do have a harder time with being consistent with my diet than I do working out so I know that's a factor.

*TLDR*
My trainer says he would like to get my RMR up to the 1500 range and he thinks that'll have more impact with my weight loss/fat loss. It's currently in the high 1300 range. It's gone up by about 70 over the last year. Seems like a silly question but is it really possible to increase your RMR by that much? And does my current RMR seem low. Everything I've googled kinda looks like it's lower than average.

EDIT: I know RMR is the number of calories you burn at rest, basically doing nothing. So basically my trainer wants to build my body to where it's able to burn more calories from just existing. Probably because I have times when I'm not as consistent with what I'm eating and tracking. I currently try to eat around 1500 to 1700 calories which puts me in a deficit of about 500 to 700 from how much I was eating when I put on weight. But I've definitely had moments where I was probably eating at maintenance when I stopped tracking.

I started lifting end of April into May (stronglifts), I had a back Injury and then a sprained ankle in early June and that kept me from wanting to go back until July.  I've since been lifting every other day and switched to a GZCL routine and I do a hike or a 3+ mph 10+% incline walk on the treadmill for 1 hour at least every day I don't lift with some conditioning work thrown in.

Today (August 8) I am 182.625 LBs with a 38"" waist with an estimated 24.8% body fat.  I figured my maintenance calories to be just over 2000 by not changing anything about my diet and calculating my average calories for a week.  Since then I've maintained an average Caloric intake of just under 1600 and that doesn't factor in any calories burned by exercise.  My weights on my lifts are still going up, but I've started not being able to make it to 10 reps on some of my T2 exercises and have just started decreasing to 8 reps and maintain progressive overload via weight.  I haven't failed a T1 lift yet.

I like seeing the weights on my lifts go up and my bodyweight go down.  2 years ago I was 160 LBs with my average weight since adulthood varying between 145 and 160.  There's a part of me that wants to reach 160 again before bulking, another part of me that wants to hit 170, and another part of me that wonders if I should increase Caloric intake to make sure my muscle mass is increasing (I do see and feel some slight increases).

My question is:  can I continue to cut to lose weight and have it not be counterproductive to trying to increase muscle mass?  And what is a sign that I should slow down with the weight loss and increase Caloric intake or reduce cardio?

I can eat clean and stick to a productive lifestyle fine on my own except the people around me who I share meals with don’t have the same goals I do. This results in me eating shitty like 20% of the time. What strategies have you come up with to stay consistent in your diet when your family, friends, and co-workers eat very differently?

Program Overview  
Juggernaut 2.0 is designed to be for developing all round athleticism. Its not a powerlifting program and the focus is on sub maximal training becausr the only irreplaceable part of a training program is the sport itself.  Theres only one set in the 16 week program for each lift at 90%.  
The lifts are run in 4 week cycles focusing on 10 reps, 8 reps, 5 reps and 3 reps with a deload every 4th week.  
I did the ""What I Do"" for the accessories (Pullups, Dips, Ab Wheel, Good Mornings, Hamstrings, Lunges, Squats) and used simplified conditioning (30s '@ 70% Watts rowing, 8 press ups, 10 sit ups, 15s Rest)  
  
My Background  
I'd previously been running a powerbuilding program that i added cardio to. This meant i was doing 6 weight sessions a week 40 minutes-1 hour and 5 cardio session of 30 minutes. And with getting changed, grabbing a coffee and prep this was taking 10 hours a week. I've got a young son so that sort of routine was no longer viable.  
  
I do Judo mainly so Strength and Conditioning isnt going to be my priority, i also have a 15 month old, so i was missing sessions and cutting assistance / cardio short all over the place, saying id do abs later and forgetting about stretching.  
  
What I liked  
Doing abs first as a warm up meant i was no longer skipping them, as long as i dont half ass the workout I'm able to finish in an hour, including taking 5 minutes at the end to stretch.  
Adding sprinting in really helped with things like playing 5 a side football on a stag do and general athelicism.  
I've not tested my jumps really, but doing weighted jumps hopefully will lead to being about to dunk a basketball, not really a major objective.  
The plate halos uncovered a weakness in my neck/ upper back that I resolved by doing really light weights nice and slowly.  
Emphasis on pullups and dips kept my general athleticism for Murph without needing specific prep.   
Four days a week gives a lot of flexibility for when life gets in the way, even if you have to go away with work for a couple of days you can move the workouts around.  
Deload weeks mean you're not building up too much soreness and they always seemed to come at a time i could do with being in the gym for less time, which was lucky.  
Sub maximal training meant i wasnt destroying myself before a Judo session, and especially on the deload weeks i could perform really highly in training (sport training has too many variables based on lesson plan, who shows up to plan intensity so having a lot left in the tank is useful)  
Switching out exercises gave a lot of variety, i switched to Front Squats to reduce the load on my lower back as Judo tends to do a lot of that for posture and behind the neck press rather than militsry because ive liked the shoulder gains i got from that.  
  
What Im confused about  
Doing sprints before lower body seems to reduce my maximum sets, not sure if i should swtich it round for realisation week, if im wrong about the order or if because its not specifically powerlifting focused the sprinting should take priority for great athleticism.   
I added some warm up sets on the exercise i was doing which i don't remember from the ebook. I also found i wasn't really ready for the 3+ realisation set and needed to do more doubles. It might mean the rest of my warm up is too light.   
  
Conclusion  
Im only realising now that the point of keeping the increments small is that you can drop your reps on the AMRAP and continue hitting greater estimated 1rm, so if you managed a 80x16 last 10s wave time, and have a bad day after youve increased to 90 for your working weight, you can still go north of 10 reps, rather than constantly hitting to minimum required reps and having no where else to progress.  
Im spending less time, getting more done and am back to or past my previous lifetime 1rm. Not sure theres really a downside to this for me.  
I didnt follow the schedule for peaking at the end of the 16 week program so really couldnt have expected my 1rm to be as high as calculated.  
  
Whats next  
I'm going to run another cycle to see if this progress is sustainable or if it was just a combination of starting very light and regaining previously lost strength. The weights section of program seems to be heavily inspired by 5/3/1 so it might be worth my looking into that after this cycle to see if i can get more touches at 90% and above because me lower rep work was rubbish!

,fitness30plus,"37/f and I've just started lifting heavy in the gym in the middle of April. For about 18 months prior, I was strength training at home with a bench and bowflex adjustable dumbbells. I've lost, and have been maintaining, 85lbs over the last two years. As I'm getting into heavier lifting, my goal is mostly body comp: continue losing fat and to increase strength.  

So I figured out my first two goals: 100lb bench press and 200lb deadlift. Today I went for the bench and surpassed my goal with 2 reps at 105. It feels like a baby number, but my powerlifter husband assures me it's pretty good progress for 3.5 months.

For about 18 months prior, I was strength training at home with a bench and bowflex adjustable dumbbells. I&amp;#39;ve lost, and have been maintaining, 85lbs over the last two years. As I&amp;#39;m getting into heavier lifting, my goal is mostly body comp: continue losing fat and to increase strength.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I figured out my first two goals: 100lb bench press and 200lb deadlift. Today I went for the bench and surpassed my goal with 2 reps at 105. It feels like a baby number, but my powerlifter husband assures me it&amp;#39;s pretty good progress for 3.5 months.

I lift weights (heavy) 3-4x a week, hitting on avg 100g of protein daily, and get more than 10k steps daily over the past month. Prior to this I was already lifting for the past 2 years, but with no structured program or nutrition tracking. After tracking my calories for the last month with MFP and nSunns tracker, I've come to learn that my TDEE is between 1,500 - 1,600 cals, and I have most likely been eating at maintenance. The lean muscle gains have been minimal (or maybe I think this because my BF % is on the higher end) but strength has been significant. I tried to do a cut at 1,400 cals and was losing 0.2kg a week, but have found this difficult to sustain.

Anyway, this is where I'm 'stuck', as I've seen the positive effects of reverse diet on this sub and also read / watched videos about it on Youtube. It makes so much sense to slowly start eating more calories to help build lean muscle so that I reach a point where cutting becomes sustainable.

&lt;p&gt;My question is this: does cycle strokes count as steps too? (This might sound ridiculous, but I am doing everything in my power to age healthfully and gracefully, as about 3 years ago I was dealthy ill and have been building myself back up since then)&lt;/p&gt;

I am 41 and believe it or not have had an ED for the last twenty years. I am 176cm and at my worst was under 50kg. Now 72kg.

As a single day I have limited time. My daughter is 5 and takes most of my time. I am lucky if I can get an hour to myself each day, so gym trips are unlikely at this point.

Believe it or not I eat reasonably well. Fruit, oats and some almonds for breakfast. Spinach, salmon and chicken for lunch. And for dinner usually chicken breast, carrots, sweet potato. During the day I while snack on apples and almonds. I have not eaten junk food for three decades and no juice or alcohol.

I started trying to eat more to gain energy to keep up with my daughter but it has just become instant fat.

Activity wise I do basic sit-ups, push-ups and light weights for 30 minutes each day and approximately 20 minutes intentional walking. Lots of running around after my daughter.

,fitness30plus,"Today is the 1yr anniversary of my triple cervical discectomy.  I spent nearly 2 months couch bound and 3 months out from any training at all.

Since then I've recovered (other than the permanent radiculopathy) and smashed several of my goals.

Lost some weight in that time but managed to stay lean-ish knowing Id be back after it soon.

I did a meet May 11th and was really unhappy with the outcome.  I decided to try once more June1 and that was going to decide for me if I'm done, or if I've got more in me, and as it turns out I've got more to give.

Hit 556/352/650 10 months post op.

Taking a long offseason to stay on track for my main goal of 661/418/721.  79/46/71 over my all time individual bests.

Sharing for a reminder to those who think theyre too hurt to keep going or its too late to make progress.... you're not and its not.  Just have to be relentless.

,fitness30plus,"Hola, 
So - approximately half way through a pretty significant weight cut  (down approximately 50 lbs, 388 to 338 in 4.5 months - 40 years old - 6 ft 1, always the ‘big guy’ not so much the ‘fat guy’ )
Most of it through clean eating/calorie tracking (Lose it! app) with Weight Lifting,  approx. 3-4 times per week.
I get most of my cardio requirements through work (first responder - I can hustle for a big boy ! Lol ) 
Anyways - my training is changing more to lifting heavier, and focusing on some muscle development as I continue to cut weight (Goal is ultimately 280 lbs) and my very very fit co-worker recommended that I start taking Creatine 15-25 mg per day - with some good scientific sources to back up the recommendation. He believes that this dose wouldn’t lead to much if any water retention issues/weight gain.
He’s also in his mid 20s and incredibly fit - lol

I suppose my question is:
At my age, do ya’ll believe that introducing Creatine during a weight cut is a smart thing to do ? Or maybe wait until I’m closer to that ultimate weight goal and introduce it then ? 
I’m mainly apprehensive as I’ve been averaging approximately 11 lbs lost per month, and have been pretty happy with how this process has come - and am nervous to make any changes to something that’s clearly working quite well.
Just looking for some opinions I suppose.

Thanks for your time :)

Dramatic life event last year. Was around 285 lbs.

Now around 175 lbs.

This has been done through calorie restriction and weight lifting a couple times a week (fully body workout each time).

Scared to stop calorie restriction because I want to get rid of the last few lbs of belly fat but am afraid to gain back.

Some advice I got from a friend is maybe to try to add in zone 2 cardio.

,fitness30plus,"Started cutting and working out late January and was 230 lbs. Some on and off lifting experience in college, and I have a very active job, but obviously a beginner. I’ve been eating anywhere between 1900-2300 calories per day and lifting 6 days a week with a little bit of cardio thrown in each day as well.

I\'m revisiting this without looking back at the old guide. (Which I wrote when I had pressed 275 at 200 pounds of body weight)\n\n\nThe main reason to write this without revisiting the old one was to see what advice stayed the same and what advice changed over the years. I believe it took me approximately 2 years (I could be off by a little) to add this 25 pounds to my press.\n\nPlease note, this is what has worked for me. I\'m not suggesting anything about this will work for you or is even expert advice.\n\n----------\n\n1) OHP should be the first thing you do in the week. This is true for whatever lift you want to focus on most likely. If you\'re doing a pretty traditional upper/lower split, but you\'re doing OHP as a secondary lift in day 1, or just as bad, waiting until the second upper day, chances are you\'re going to have slower progress on the press. That being said, your secondary press will probably take a back burner. You can progress it, but you’ll most likely see faster progression on the 1st press of the week in my experience.\n\n -----\n\n2) Your accessories should be built around improving the press. Think of what you\'re asking your body to do on a heavy OHP. You\'re asking your shoulders to stabilize weight above your head. Your triceps to move a massive amounts of weight. You\'re asking your lower back to stop you from bending over backwards and your quads to stay strong and stable on the ground. So other than OHP, what things should you be doing to improve this?\n\n \n* A) More OHP. Yeah, duh right? It doesn\'t have to be more of the same OHP as your main variation, but more OHP in general. It wasn\'t uncommon for me to program my main OHP sets, then just do more OHP as back down sets.\n\n\nRecently I came off of a training block that involved working up to heavy doubles and then back down sets after. After that I programmed more back off sets at a lower weight. My shoulders would be pretty fried by then so more back down sets didn\'t need to be as heavy.\n\n\nAfter that I would do more back down sets, but of a different (usually harder variation). For me this was the Behind the neck press, but it could be a Z Press or something similar.\n\nFor the first time in my training I was also doing DB OHP as an accesory. I had basically neglected DB\'s for everything except for rows and curls throughout my lifting career. I felt immediate stabalizing effects after adding these in.\n\n \n\n* B) Tricep movements that add significant load. Look, I\'m not saying that tricep pushdowns aren\'t good. They\'re good for a lot of things and I still do them as a nice finisher at the end of an upper body workout.\n\nThat being said, your triceps are stronger than that and can handle so much more weight. Good examples would be close grip bench press and weighted dips.\n\n\nMost recently, after watching a video of Alan Thrall talk about how overhead tricep extensions has greatly helped his circus db press I had a huge realization. (It also worked wonders for my Circus DB)\n\nWhy not train my triceps in a way that would directly correlate with an OHP? Insert Barbell overhead extensions! I really do believe this was a game changer on my OHP strength.\n\n\nDon\'t be scared to go heavy on these either. I had started light and was doing 45-65 pounds until I decided to do a ""max"" one day for fun. I worked up close to 200 pounds and realized I had been sandbagging this as an accessory.\n\nNow I go from a percentage of that, increasing weight weekly as I meet a minimal rep count of a number of sets. For most of my accessories I choose a weight about 50% of my max and have a goal of doing at least 30 reps over 3 sets. If I can meet that goal I increase the weight by 5 pounds every week. Once I can’t meet that goal I stick with that weight, even if it means doing 4-5 sets.\n\n \n* C) Direct shoulder work. So yeah, while OHP and heavy tricep work should be the main focus, the shoulders are still half of the movers in an press and should get their own focus.\n\nAt the end of my day 1 shoulder work, even though my shoulders were usually swollen, red, and pumped beyond belief, I would toss in lateral raises, front raises, and rear delt flys.\n\nThe weight hardly ever moved up on these and sometimes as my OHP went up, I would have to reduce weight on these to get through sets. I didn\'t stress it, these were always extra.\n\nThe stronger the delts, the more stability on the press, and the more pop off the chest you\'ll get.\n\n\n* D) Lower back and core work. Too many times have I lost a press behind me or in front of me because of the lack of core strength. (and sometimes just poor bar path) I focused hard on doing DAILY direct lower back (very light) and core work (heavy, but lower volume so I could recover). On top of that doing things like front squats, deadlifts, farmers, and other big compounds that stressed the trunk. Sandbag work and conditioning that involved carrying something.\n\n-----\n\n3) Have a secondary press day. Even if this comes after a bench press, but just pressing more than once in a week in general. I would make this day strongman implement focused with a lot of push jerk and push press. Just getting a variety of implements and styles in. (Usually log or axle for me)\n\n\nAlso don\'t sleep on incline bench. This has been another big factor in improving my OHP. It has good carry over to both bench press and OHP. Working both heavy paused reps and lighter touch and go reps can really help you develop the pop of the chest/shoulders in an OHP.\n\n-----\n\n4) Get bigger biceps and lats. Yeah, we know the shoulders and triceps are important, but when you stack an OHP correctly, your forearms should be pressed hard against your biceps and your triceps should be pressed hard against your lats. This causes a spring loaded feeling and action and really propels the press off of the chest/shoulders. So don\'t just add some curls or lat pulldowns at the end of your workout. Treat them as serious as you would anything else. The bigger and stronger they are, the better.\n\n -----\n\n5) If you gain body weight while training really hard chances are your press will go up. It\'s not just a coincidence that both my body weight AND my press went up by exactly 15 pounds each during this training block.\n\nInstead of making a new point, I\'ll talk about this a little more. Big guys are always trying to give me OHP advice and some of it is really good. (guys close to 300 pounds) That being said, they are always surprised when I try to explain to them that it\'s a different lift for smaller guys. The technique and form will simply look different based off of how leverages work.\n \n\nWhen a 300 pound person strict presses 300 pounds, their center is a pretty big range, because well.. they\'re big. They also have the mass to stand pretty upright while completing a press.\n\nFor a smaller person, not only are their center of gravity smaller, but chances are when you\'re lifting anything heavier than your body weight it\'s going to start bending you backwards. It\'s just how it is. It\'s not bad technique, it\'s just THE technique that must happen for a strict press when you\'re a smaller person pressing a bigger weight. As you get stronger, weights that used to bend you over might not later on, but the maximum lifts will almost always do this.\n\n\nAssume that anything near, slightly above, and for sure much heavier than your body weight is going to cause you to lean backwards. It\'s a feature, not a flaw.\n\n -----\n\n6) You\'re going to have to do more volume than you might want to (in my experience) and that means meaningful volume.\n\n\nHere\'s an example of what my current training is like: (Only upper days included)\n\n**Day 1:**\n\n* Strict OHP Main programming (8-10 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)\n\n* Strict OHP Back down sets (20 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)\n\n* Behind the neck pressing (30 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)\n\n* DB OHP Press (30 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)\n\n* Barbell Overhead Extension: (30 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)\n\n* Barbell Upright row: (30 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)\n\n* Lateral raises, front raises, rear delt flys: (30 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)\n\n \n\n**Day 2: (not the second day in my training, but my second upper day)**\n\n* Log Press or axle press: (approximately 15 total reps)\n\n* (The rest of this day is strongman event stuff)\n\n \n\n**Day 3: (again, the 3rd upper body day, not the 3rd day in training)**\n\n* Incline Bench Press (8-10 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)\n\n* Incline bench press back down sets (20 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)\n\n* Bench Press (15 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)\n\n* Chest Flys (30 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)\n\n* Weighted Dips (30 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)\n\n* Tricep Pushdowns (By fail to failure, 50-100 reps)\n\n \n\n**All together on Day 1:**\n\n\nOHP Reps: Approx 90 reps over 8-12 sets\n\nDirect tricep: 30 reps\n\nDirect shoulder: 120 reps\n\n \n\nSo on day 1, you can see I\'m at close to 100 total reps of OHP before I even get into triceps and shoulders direct work.\n \n\nThis might not seem lot a ton, but please taking into consideration that the last rep of the majority of these sets are taken to either complete failure or 1-2 reps from failure (after the strength work)\n\nThese were just not junk volume, holding back effort in hopes of getting the reps of my next lift. These were movements where I couldn\'t move more arms anymore even with a bit of momentum or taking a five second breather. These were the minimum reps I took. I would do half reps and forced reps with momentum to pop out a few more. I took it as a badge of honor if I couldn’t finish my accessories later on in the workout as programmed. It means I gave it hell during the entire session.\n\n -----\n\n7) Be patient. In a few ways.\n\n \nThe first way being, OHP is a son of gun. There are days where I could hit doubles with 30-40 pounds less than my max and days where a single with 30-40 pounds less than my max WAS a one rep max on that day. If any big compound doesn\'t like fatigue, it\'s OHP. You\'re going to have to train in a way that you\'re always fatigued for it to increase. So just expect the ups and downs as part of the journey. I would literally see months where I thought I was making no progress, but the small PR’s would eventually roll in. Weights that I could only do for 1 became doubles. Weights that I could do for triples I could now get for 4, etc…\n\n\nThe more important way, and something that I\'ve been getting much better at, is be patient with the actual press itself. A heavy press will take awhile, and I\'ve started thinking as a two part lift.\n\n\nPart 1: Get that bar off of your chest/shoulders fast. You saw me mention this a few times. This is why we did all of those shoulders, paused incline bench, db presses, etc... Send it with speed. Your shoulders are explosive and powerful, get this thing moving. Biceps stacked against forearms, triceps stacked against lats, launch that baby into orbit.\n\n \nPart 2: Chances are your one rep max might stop for a second somewhere around the top of your head or slightly higher. It might feel like an eternity. Fight and don’t stop until it starts moving downward. It could be a grind, but we are doing everything in our power to get the bar high enough that our triceps can take over. That could be the smallest of distances. If it doesn’t feel like it’s coming down give it hell like your life depended on it.\n\n\nIf you watch my 300 press video you can hear me verbally yell ""YES"". This was the exact moment that I felt my triceps take over and I knew I\'d complete the rep. This is why we did all of the HEAVY tricep work and not just fluff volume.\n \n\n**Other:**\n\n\nPlease note how I didn’t talk about getting your head through, squeezing your glutes, or any of the other common OHP tips.\n\n\nThese are all good things and should probably be done. (Even though I have never thought squeeze my glutes on any lift ever in my life) Instead, brace hard. Your entire body, not just your glutes. You should be braced in your toes, feet, legs, trunk, etc… You’re not bracing hard enough if you can focus on squeezing one single body part.\n\n\nGetting your head through will simply happen faster on lighter lifts. It is the end goal, but really not even necessary. It’s a cue to help you keep the bar over your center of gravity. If it helps then go for it. If you’re competing in something that involves getting your head through on an OHP than train that way. I personally don’t train that way unless I’m doing 1 rep maxes or am a week or two out from competitions. I’ve seen no strength/hypertrophy value in doing so and I rather just get to the next rep.\n\n \n\n \n\n', 'author_fullname': 't2_1rd5qvdw', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': ""Fro's Guide to a Big OHP "", 'link_flair_richtext': [{'e': 'text', 't': 'Quality Content'}], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/weightroom', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': '', 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_1ea8sv2', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': None, 'upvote_ratio': 0.97, 'author_flair_background_color': '#d3d6da', 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 258, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': '162cffec-05ca-11e1-a30a-12313d18857a', 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'Quality Content', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 258, 'approved_by': None, 'is_created_from_ads_ui': False, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [{'e': 'text', 't': 'Mr. Arm Squats'}], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1721743816.0, 'link_flair_type': 'richtext', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'richtext', 'domain': 'self.weightroom', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credentials:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) 300 Strict (Standing) OHP at 215 pounds of body weight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/GYM/s/6vcWdBR90M""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/GYM/s/6vcWdBR90M&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Pretends to play a Strongman on the internet AND in real life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wrote a guide for this a long time ago and I thought I would revisit this.

So other than OHP, what things should you be doing to improve this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A) More OHP. Yeah, duh right? It doesn&amp;#39;t have to be more of the same OHP as your main variation, but more OHP in general. It wasn&amp;#39;t uncommon for me to program my main OHP sets, then just do more OHP as back down sets.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently I came off of a training block that involved working up to heavy doubles and then back down sets after. After that I programmed more back off sets at a lower weight. My shoulders would be pretty fried by then so more back down sets didn&amp;#39;t need to be as heavy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that I would do more back down sets, but of a different (usually harder variation). For me this was the Behind the neck press, but it could be a Z Press or something similar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the first time in my training I was also doing DB OHP as an accesory. I had basically neglected DB&amp;#39;s for everything except for rows and curls throughout my lifting career. I felt immediate stabalizing effects after adding these in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;B) Tricep movements that add significant load. Look, I&amp;#39;m not saying that tricep pushdowns aren&amp;#39;t good. They&amp;#39;re good for a lot of things and I still do them as a nice finisher at the end of an upper body workout.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, your triceps are stronger than that and can handle so much more weight. Good examples would be close grip bench press and weighted dips.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most recently, after watching a video of Alan Thrall talk about how overhead tricep extensions has greatly helped his circus db press I had a huge realization. (It also worked wonders for my Circus DB)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why not train my triceps in a way that would directly correlate with an OHP? Insert Barbell overhead extensions! I really do believe this was a game changer on my OHP strength.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be scared to go heavy on these either. I had started light and was doing 45-65 pounds until I decided to do a &amp;quot;max&amp;quot; one day for fun. I worked up close to 200 pounds and realized I had been sandbagging this as an accessory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I go from a percentage of that, increasing weight weekly as I meet a minimal rep count of a number of sets. For most of my accessories I choose a weight about 50% of my max and have a goal of doing at least 30 reps over 3 sets. If I can meet that goal I increase the weight by 5 pounds every week. Once I can’t meet that goal I stick with that weight, even if it means doing 4-5 sets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;C) Direct shoulder work. So yeah, while OHP and heavy tricep work should be the main focus, the shoulders are still half of the movers in an press and should get their own focus.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of my day 1 shoulder work, even though my shoulders were usually swollen, red, and pumped beyond belief, I would toss in lateral raises, front raises, and rear delt flys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The weight hardly ever moved up on these and sometimes as my OHP went up, I would have to reduce weight on these to get through sets. I didn&amp;#39;t stress it, these were always extra.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The stronger the delts, the more stability on the press, and the more pop off the chest you&amp;#39;ll get.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;D) Lower back and core work. Too many times have I lost a press behind me or in front of me because of the lack of core strength. (and sometimes just poor bar path) I focused hard on doing DAILY direct lower back (very light) and core work (heavy, but lower volume so I could recover). On top of that doing things like front squats, deadlifts, farmers, and other big compounds that stressed the trunk. Sandbag work and conditioning that involved carrying something.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Have a secondary press day. Even if this comes after a bench press, but just pressing more than once in a week in general. I would make this day strongman implement focused with a lot of push jerk and push press. Just getting a variety of implements and styles in. (Usually log or axle for me)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also don&amp;#39;t sleep on incline bench. This has been another big factor in improving my OHP. It has good carry over to both bench press and OHP. Working both heavy paused reps and lighter touch and go reps can really help you develop the pop of the chest/shoulders in an OHP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Get bigger biceps and lats. Yeah, we know the shoulders and triceps are important, but when you stack an OHP correctly, your forearms should be pressed hard against your biceps and your triceps should be pressed hard against your lats. This causes a spring loaded feeling and action and really propels the press off of the chest/shoulders. So don&amp;#39;t just add some curls or lat pulldowns at the end of your workout. Treat them as serious as you would anything else. The bigger and stronger they are, the better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) If you gain body weight while training really hard chances are your press will go up. It&amp;#39;s not just a coincidence that both my body weight AND my press went up by exactly 15 pounds each during this training block.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of making a new point, I&amp;#39;ll talk about this a little more. Big guys are always trying to give me OHP advice and some of it is really good. (guys close to 300 pounds) That being said, they are always surprised when I try to explain to them that it&amp;#39;s a different lift for smaller guys. The technique and form will simply look different based off of how leverages work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When a 300 pound person strict presses 300 pounds, their center is a pretty big range, because well.. they&amp;#39;re big. They also have the mass to stand pretty upright while completing a press.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a smaller person, not only are their center of gravity smaller, but chances are when you&amp;#39;re lifting anything heavier than your body weight it&amp;#39;s going to start bending you backwards. It&amp;#39;s just how it is. It&amp;#39;s not bad technique, it&amp;#39;s just THE technique that must happen for a strict press when you&amp;#39;re a smaller person pressing a bigger weight. As you get stronger, weights that used to bend you over might not later on, but the maximum lifts will almost always do this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assume that anything near, slightly above, and for sure much heavier than your body weight is going to cause you to lean backwards. It&amp;#39;s a feature, not a flaw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6) You&amp;#39;re going to have to do more volume than you might want to (in my experience) and that means meaningful volume.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an example of what my current training is like: (Only upper days included)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strict OHP Main programming (8-10 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strict OHP Back down sets (20 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the neck pressing (30 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;DB OHP Press (30 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barbell Overhead Extension: (30 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barbell Upright row: (30 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lateral raises, front raises, rear delt flys: (30 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: (not the second day in my training, but my second upper day)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Log Press or axle press: (approximately 15 total reps)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The rest of this day is strongman event stuff)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 3: (again, the 3rd upper body day, not the 3rd day in training)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incline Bench Press (8-10 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incline bench press back down sets (20 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bench Press (15 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chest Flys (30 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weighted Dips (30 reps spread out over 2-3 sets)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tricep Pushdowns (By fail to failure, 50-100 reps)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All together on Day 1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OHP Reps: Approx 90 reps over 8-12 sets&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Direct tricep: 30 reps&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Direct shoulder: 120 reps&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So on day 1, you can see I&amp;#39;m at close to 100 total reps of OHP before I even get into triceps and shoulders direct work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This might not seem lot a ton, but please taking into consideration that the last rep of the majority of these sets are taken to either complete failure or 1-2 reps from failure (after the strength work)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These were just not junk volume, holding back effort in hopes of getting the reps of my next lift. These were movements where I couldn&amp;#39;t move more arms anymore even with a bit of momentum or taking a five second breather. These were the minimum reps I took. I would do half reps and forced reps with momentum to pop out a few more. I took it as a badge of honor if I couldn’t finish my accessories later on in the workout as programmed. It means I gave it hell during the entire session.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7) Be patient. In a few ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first way being, OHP is a son of gun. There are days where I could hit doubles with 30-40 pounds less than my max and days where a single with 30-40 pounds less than my max WAS a one rep max on that day. If any big compound doesn&amp;#39;t like fatigue, it&amp;#39;s OHP. You&amp;#39;re going to have to train in a way that you&amp;#39;re always fatigued for it to increase. So just expect the ups and downs as part of the journey. I would literally see months where I thought I was making no progress, but the small PR’s would eventually roll in. Weights that I could only do for 1 became doubles. Weights that I could do for triples I could now get for 4, etc…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more important way, and something that I&amp;#39;ve been getting much better at, is be patient with the actual press itself. A heavy press will take awhile, and I&amp;#39;ve started thinking as a two part lift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part 1: Get that bar off of your chest/shoulders fast. You saw me mention this a few times. This is why we did all of those shoulders, paused incline bench, db presses, etc... Send it with speed. Your shoulders are explosive and powerful, get this thing moving. Biceps stacked against forearms, triceps stacked against lats, launch that baby into orbit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part 2: Chances are your one rep max might stop for a second somewhere around the top of your head or slightly higher. It might feel like an eternity. Fight and don’t stop until it starts moving downward. It could be a grind, but we are doing everything in our power to get the bar high enough that our triceps can take over. That could be the smallest of distances. If it doesn’t feel like it’s coming down give it hell like your life depended on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you watch my 300 press video you can hear me verbally yell &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot;. This was the exact moment that I felt my triceps take over and I knew I&amp;#39;d complete the rep. This is why we did all of the HEAVY tricep work and not just fluff volume.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please note how I didn’t talk about getting your head through, squeezing your glutes, or any of the other common OHP tips.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are all good things and should probably be done. (Even though I have never thought squeeze my glutes on any lift ever in my life) Instead, brace hard. Your entire body, not just your glutes. You should be braced in your toes, feet, legs, trunk, etc… You’re not bracing hard enough if you can focus on squeezing one single body part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Getting your head through will simply happen faster on lighter lifts. It is the end goal, but really not even necessary. It’s a cue to help you keep the bar over your center of gravity. If it helps then go for it. If you’re competing in something that involves getting your head through on an OHP than train that way. I personally don’t train that way unless I’m doing 1 rep maxes or am a week or two out from competitions. I’ve seen no strength/hypertrophy value in doing so and I rather just get to the next rep.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'link_flair_template_id': '877edcee-6643-11e7-8d77-0e803257f460', 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': 'Mr. Arm Squats', 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2ssmu', 'author_is_blocked': False, 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '#ff66ac', 'id': '1ea8sv2', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'Frodozer', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 47, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'permalink': '/r/weightroom/comments/1ea8sv2/fros_guide_to_a_big_ohp/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1ea8sv2/fros_guide_to_a_big_ohp/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 391989, 'created_utc': 1721743816.0, 'num_crossposts': 3, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}]",1721744093.0,text,,,,text,self.weightroom,False,,,,,/r/weightroom/comments/1ea8sv2/fros_guide_to_a_big_ohp/,,False,False,False,False,False,,[],[],False,False,False,False,Shoulder Press for Shoulder Health,[],False,,,,t5_2zswl,False,,,,1ea8wpm,True,,Frodozer,,3,True,,False,[],False,t3_1ea8sv2,dark,/r/fitness30plus/comments/1ea8wpm/fros_guide_to_a_big_ohp/,,False,/r/weightroom/comments/1ea8sv2/fros_guide_to_a_big_ohp/,158356,1721744093.0,0,,False,,,,

In 5 weeks, I went from 204lbs down to 190lbs, losing weight reliably every week. However, for the past 3 weeks I have stayed at 190lbs.

I meticulously count calories every single day, I never eat more than what I log in MyFitnessPal. I average 1550 calories per day.
I weigh myself the same day, every week, and at the same time, with the same clothes. I have upheld my diet and deficit average of 1550 by eating essentially the same foods per week.

I specifically only eat food that’s easy for me to track and doesn't require eyeballing. I don't cook with added oils, or use any sauces or dressings. I only drink water, or a cup of apple juice at dinner if calories allow. If something isn't labeled, I use a scale to measure the weight and look up USDA nutrition estimates, as well as check MyFitnessPal for entries. If something is listed but varies wildly in calorie count, I always choose the highest calorie count listed and adjust my day.

I lift weights 4 times a week and do progressive overload, seeing regular strength gains overtime. Otherwise, I live a sedentary life.

I started dieting and exercising in May out of the blue, so it is brand new but I haven't ""cheated"" my diet once. I don't do cheat meals or cheat days, and I don't skip any exercise days, and I don't binge eat.

,fitness30plus,"Hi all.

Im trying to do a body recomp. Cutting major fat and increasing my muscle mass. Nothing crazy but i dont want to just be skinny. 

I priortize cardio on my peloton bike and then do about 10 to 15 minutes of strength training through the Peloton app. The strength training is rep heavy and leaves me pretty breathless and muscles dead. Really no heavy lifting.

Couple questions for you all...
1) is my workout routine going to help me achieve my goal? Should i try to strike more of a balance between cardio and strength training?
2) im trying to only take in about 1800 calories per day. Which is about a 600 calorie deficit. How much protein should i be taking in?

My current stats:
Male - 37
Weight -215
Estimated body fat % (from a scale) - 30%

Goal weight - 180
Goal body fat % - 15%

,fitness30plus,"Hi everyone,

This is my first post and I'm posting because I'm kind of lost. Ive always been quite active, did ballet as a kid and played basketball at uni.

Two years ago I started having panic attacks and relapsed back into depression. I became sedentary and started eating lots of junk food. Depression sucks. Now I want to get healthier and start exercising again on a regular basis. 

It feels kind of weird though. Thing is: I've had an eating disorder for a very long time (anorexia and bulimia), so starting this 'fitness journey' is scary. I'm scared it will trigger old habits and that I'll relapse. However, I do have to get healthier. My clothes don't fit properly anymore and I feel unhealthy. 

Creating a routine feels difficult: I want to be strict, but not too strict. I want to push myself, but not to an unhealthy extent. I've now created this routine for myself:

Monday: strength training
Tuesday: rest day, bit of yoga or walking
Wednesday: strength training
Thursday: running
Friday: rest day, yoga/running
Saturday: strength training 
Sunday: spinning class

Am starting at the most basic level, strength training is simply five compound exercises,  starting with a 15 kg barbell or 4 kg dumbbells. I intend to increase that weight when I'm able to lift 4x 8 reps with two extra reps effortlessly (I believe this technique has a name, but I forgot sorry!) 

Running is also very basic, starting with 4x 2 minutes running. I intend to increase that every month or so. 

I really wanted to check with you whether my routine is okay. There's just so much information on the Internet.  😟 it's making me insecure. 

I know it's all about balance, but I also really want to see results without relapsing into an ED. Am I asking too much of myself?

,fitness30plus,"I'm 40m - about 4 years training experience but only the last 2 years following linear progression programs properly. I work 45 hours per week in a reasonably physical job. Diet is on point at around 4000 C .. mostly clean .. Done 531 BBB -&gt; Tactical Barbell protocols -&gt; currently on week 16 of SBS hypertrophy.

I deload as recommended by all programs.. I do a bit of physical therapy and I have a lifting coach I see occasionally just to help me dial in my technique on compound lifts.

SBS has been great. I'm hitting PRs every session.. my lifts have gone up significantly - I've gained about 5kg of good weight - for the most part I'm feeling really good.

Example structure: 2 main lifts (SQ+DB OHP) - 1 back movement (weighted pull ups etc) - 2 accessories (generally bodybuilding/gym bro stuff)

HOWEVER. In the past 3 weeks or so I've hit a bit of a wall. Not on the books (linear progression, still progressing) .. but just in my head and in my energy levels... My big lifts are getting heavy... or at least heavy for me.. I'm finding that once I've completed them and the back exercise - I'm just gassed... I just took a full week off only to return to the same issue.. I've just been dropping the accessory stuff. I'm fine with that although it does kind of bug me that I'm not completing the full workout.

But the fatigue is pretty noticeable - I'm not really enjoying my time in the gym as much it's feeling like a chore I'm just dragging myself in there... hitting the numbers and leaving.

I mean ... as I said ... my Squat, Dead, Bench and OHP are all heavier than they've ever been. I'm happy with the progress there.



Anyone have any experience or advice here? I'm sort of wondering if maybe once I finish this program whether to pivot to something different... higher reps/lighter weights ... less compound stuff for a while or what... how best to manage the fatigue moving forward.

,fitness30plus,"Hello! Just wanted to share my progress. Booty needs a lot of work and lots of flabby bits that need toning, but I'm feeling pretty good today.

I used to be 200 pounds. Ive pretty much been the fat friend my entire life... the first time I remember thinking I was fat, I was in 3rd grade. 

In May of 2020 I stopped drinking and dropped about 27 lbs., but never budged much further. In June 2023 I started seeing an endocrinologist for my PCOS. He got me on medications for my insulin resistance and elevated androgens. That day I calculated my TDEE, got back on myfitnesspal for the 100th time, started counting calories and doing minimal exercises at home. Mostly, I just chased around my kids. I started throwing in squats while waiting for water to boil, jumping jacks while waiting for the shower to heat up, leg lifts and crunches, girly push ups while playing with the kids on the floor. Sometimes I'd use the stationary bike. Just sporadic things.

Anyways... I kept going this time. By November, I was down to the 130s. I saw my endo and asked if he thought I'd be a good candidate for skin removal surgery. He agreed that I would be and referred me to the head of plastics and reconstruction at the U of M. I had my consultation with him in February. He took photos of me and went over my medical history. Then he submitted my information to my insurance, BCBS, and we waited. Mid-April I heard back that my insurance found the operation to be medically necessary. May 10th, 1 day before my 39th birthday, I had my excess abdominal skin removed. 

I don't look perfect, but I'm miles away from where I started.

My goal moving forward is to gain some muscle back that I lost along the way - especially in my butt and legs.

I've been doing cable crunches for about 4 months and for at least a couple months they have been hurting my lower back/spine. Sometimes it's just a little sore for a day or two, sometimes there is acute pain when I'm doing them and a couple weeks ago I had to stop doing them because my lower back hurt too much the next day.

I don't have a video of my form but I did link a video that I think shows a similar form to mine - except I use a bar. Many people do this exercise slightly different so I wanted to show ""my"" form. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBtiDLz0y7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBtiDLz0y7s) (@1:25)

Some ideas I've had to fix this:

* Strengthen my lower back
* Change my form up in some way
* Replace it with another exercise

I really don't want to give up on this exercise since I feel a strong mind muscle connection with it and it's easy to progressively overload.

The biggest challenges I'm experiencing are that the best times in my day for me to fit it in are also at the times of day where I'm at my lowest energy level.

Mid-afternoon... I'm in my midday slump and fighting to stay awake.

After 8pm... I'm already ready to go to bed again.

Is the answer just to power through it and go anyways? I'm guessing it is but it feels like such a contrast from the level of energy I so often have.

,fitness30plus,"Question for this group as I'm told these results are not possible.

39 year old male, 6'1"" previously around 175 lbs, skinny fat body shape most of my life.  Weight training on and off with other sports since I was maybe 30 without a whole lot of change.  Got serious about making changes last year.  Got first DEXA scan in 4/2023 with 28% body fat and very low lean mass for age/sex.

Started compound lifting program of barbell bench press, overhead press, deadlift with assisted pull-ups and Bulgarian split squat (dumbell) 3x per week.  Ate at DEXA derived RMR + active calories on Apple Watch 500 calorie/day deficit for a lot of 2023 and had a ton of fat loss without lean mass loss.  Got COVID in early 2024 and fell off the wagon a bit.

Been really serious about weights and diet since April: increasing weight and eating at a neutral level of calories + minimum 2 grams of protein/kg/day.

My last DEXA shows a 2 pound lean mass gain per month from April to now.  This seems too fast for what I read is possible online.  I've lost 21 pounds of fat while gaining 10 pounds of muscle in the last 15 months.  I definitely feel as strong as I've ever felt and have muscle vasculature in my arms that I've never seen before.  Still have some fat around my midsection - no abs - but abdominal circumference has dropped from 34"" to 30"".

Is body recomposition like this really possible - at 39 years old?  Is the DEXA wrong?  I'd always read it was almost impossible to gain lean mass rapidly without ""bulking"" phases with fat GAIN, but that's what this shows.

For the past 2 months I’ve tried to get my mom in a habit of exercising, whether it’s exercising with her or trying to plan out some time everyday. However, she works a 9-5 most days where she has to stand up for the majority of that time, so by the time she comes home she becomes too tired and likes to relax/unwind from the day’s work, which is fair enough. She also has some other health problems like migraines and right arm weakness if she uses it too much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not that worried about her diet, she already eats in moderation, eats plenty of fruits/vegetables, protein, dairy etc. I am more concerned about increasing her muscle mass while losing a lot of fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr - Mom (45 year old) doesn’t have time or energy to work out after 9-5 job most days. How do I help her lose weight?&lt;/p&gt;

#Training protocol:

Six sessions spaced out over 14 days. Each session consisted of what are known as a [Wingate protocol](https://theory.labster.com/wingate-sprint/) —30 seconds of all-out effort followed by 4.5 minutes of easy exercise (like walking) done 5 times in a row, back to back, so a complete single training session is 25 minutes long. In my case I used an AirDyneX bike in a gym that had a good amount of resistance but a bike isn't required, what matters is the all-out, total body intensity.

In 5 sessions out of 6 I did the HIIT sessions after I had done my weightlifting for the day; with the sixth session, I did the Wingate protocol before lifting weights. 

One thing that surprised me was the crazy pump I got in my thighs after I was done with the fifth sprint in the session, which I took advantage of by going immediately into doing some heavy squat lifts.

#Caveats:

The dramatic gains I got out of 6 sessions has a lot to do with the fact that I wasn’t doing any cardiovascular training prior; I am essentially untrained. I also don’t think another 6 sessions is going to yield another 40% increase in my VO2 max number; as people get more and more trained in any area, it takes more and more effort to get progressively smaller gains due to diminishing returns and getting closer to your own genetic/biological limits means there’s less room for growth as time goes on.

#Background:

I’ve been doing calisthenics / r/bodyweightfitness since early 2021 and two years in I realized I should also be doing *something* for cardio. I didn’t want to run because my feet hitting the pavement would cause shin splints so I opted for jumping rope instead but trying to go from zero to 2 minutes of jumping rope took a couple weeks since I hadn’t done it since I was a kid. After a couple months I was able to do 5 minutes of moderately paced rope-jumping but I didn’t really keep up with it at this point because I wasn’t sure how to progress—add more time to 10 minutes, 20 minutes, or try to whip the rope around and jump as fast as possible?

Eventually I just stopped doing it altogether last year since I didn’t feel like I was getting much out of it for the time and energy invested.

Fast forward to 1-2 months ago and I discovered Martin Gibala’ s book [*The One-Minute Workout: Science Shows a Way to Get Fit That's Smarter, Faster, Shorter*](https://www.mediafire.com/file/txw6zt9flcqg5ep/Gibala%252C_Martin_-_The_One-Minute_Workout.pdf/file) which immediately appealed to me because I knew from my strength training background that heavy loads/intensive training produces a stronger stimulus for muscle growth than doing more reps that are of only light/moderate intensity/weight. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) works somewhat similarly.

When I came across the following passages in the book I knew I had to try this specific protocol for myself: 

&gt; “The six training sessions conducted by the subjects required them to sprint on a stationary bicycle. The specific protocol is known as a Wingate test (named after the Israeli sports institute where it was developed, the Wingate Institute), which is designed to measure someone’s anaerobic power—the all-out explosive effort necessary to bike, skate, run, or swim as fast as possible. You hop into the saddle and pedal as hard and as fast as you can for thirty seconds against a high resistance. The idea is to go all out. 'Go as hard as you can,' I told the subjects. 'As if you’re sprinting to save a child from an oncoming car—go that fast.'”

&gt; “As the results came in, it was difficult to maintain that façade of impartiality. The numbers were crazy. The sprinters had doubled their endurance times. On average, before the training, the eight subjects could pedal the bike for 26 minutes until exhaustion. Following the six sessions of interval training, the average time was 51 minutes. It was an amazing result.”

&gt; “The sprints changed the subjects’ bodies in other ways, too. We obtained biopsies of their thigh muscles before and after training. The biopsies showed that, after the training, subjects had significantly more mitochondria in their muscles—because a key enzymatic marker, citrate synthase, increased by 38%. That matters because mitochondria are the muscles’ powerhouses.”

&gt; “And keep this in mind: We used a stationary cycle for our study for pragmatic reasons, but we figured the results would be the same for any activity conducive to a sprint approach, such as running, rowing, and even stair climbing. And in the 10+ years that have passed since, this expectation has been borne out.”

So I went and did it and got great results.

Another interesting thing the book mentions is that sprint intervals was how champion long-distance runners used to train because this method did such a great job increasing VO2 max in such a short time period.",[],False,,0,False,VO2 Max Score Increased By 40% After Just 6 Training Sessions: Here’s How I (41M) Did It,[],r/fitness30plus,False,,,0,,,False,t3_1e2gru2,False,dark,0.22,,public,0,0,{},,,False,t2_aa4p7cwf,,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,False,self,1720919155.0,,[],{},self,,True,,,1720894069.0,text,,,,text,self.fitness30plus,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Results:&lt;/h1&gt;

I also don’t think another 6 sessions is going to yield another 40% increase in my VO2 max number; as people get more and more trained in any area, it takes more and more effort to get progressively smaller gains due to diminishing returns and getting closer to your own genetic/biological limits means there’s less room for growth as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Background:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing calisthenics / &lt;a href=""/r/bodyweightfitness""&gt;r/bodyweightfitness&lt;/a&gt; since early 2021 and two years in I realized I should also be doing &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; for cardio. I didn’t want to run because my feet hitting the pavement would cause shin splints so I opted for jumping rope instead but trying to go from zero to 2 minutes of jumping rope took a couple weeks since I hadn’t done it since I was a kid. After a couple months I was able to do 5 minutes of moderately paced rope-jumping but I didn’t really keep up with it at this point because I wasn’t sure how to progress—add more time to 10 minutes, 20 minutes, or try to whip the rope around and jump as fast as possible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I just stopped doing it altogether last year since I didn’t feel like I was getting much out of it for the time and energy invested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 1-2 months ago and I discovered Martin Gibala’ s book &lt;a href=""https://www.mediafire.com/file/txw6zt9flcqg5ep/Gibala%252C_Martin_-_The_One-Minute_Workout.pdf/file""&gt;&lt;em&gt;The One-Minute Workout: Science Shows a Way to Get Fit That&amp;#39;s Smarter, Faster, Shorter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which immediately appealed to me because I knew from my strength training background that heavy loads/intensive training produces a stronger stimulus for muscle growth than doing more reps that are of only light/moderate intensity/weight. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) works somewhat similarly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I came across the following passages in the book I knew I had to try this specific protocol for myself: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The six training sessions conducted by the subjects required them to sprint on a stationary bicycle. The specific protocol is known as a Wingate test (named after the Israeli sports institute where it was developed, the Wingate Institute), which is designed to measure someone’s anaerobic power—the all-out explosive effort necessary to bike, skate, run, or swim as fast as possible. You hop into the saddle and pedal as hard and as fast as you can for thirty seconds against a high resistance. The idea is to go all out. &amp;#39;Go as hard as you can,&amp;#39; I told the subjects. &amp;#39;As if you’re sprinting to save a child from an oncoming car—go that fast.&amp;#39;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As the results came in, it was difficult to maintain that façade of impartiality. The numbers were crazy. The sprinters had doubled their endurance times. On average, before the training, the eight subjects could pedal the bike for 26 minutes until exhaustion. Following the six sessions of interval training, the average time was 51 minutes. It was an amazing result.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The sprints changed the subjects’ bodies in other ways, too. We obtained biopsies of their thigh muscles before and after training. The biopsies showed that, after the training, subjects had significantly more mitochondria in their muscles—because a key enzymatic marker, citrate synthase, increased by 38%. That matters because mitochondria are the muscles’ powerhouses.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And keep this in mind: We used a stationary cycle for our study for pragmatic reasons, but we figured the results would be the same for any activity conducive to a sprint approach, such as running, rowing, and even stair climbing. And in the 10+ years that have passed since, this expectation has been borne out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I went and did it and got great results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting thing the book mentions is that sprint intervals was how champion long-distance runners used to train because this method did such a great job increasing VO2 max in such a short time period.&lt;/p&gt;

,fitness30plus,"EDIT: I changed the word “pain” to “discomfort” - the feeling is while I’m running, afterwards I don’t have too much continuing pain/discomfort - thank you for the replies so far!!! 

I (F/35) am new to running - new to consistent exercise in general. June 29 I just up and did a mile (running and walking) - and have done a mile (run/walk) or 2 mile (speed walk) every day since.

When I run/walk the mile, I will run/jog until my lower leg begins to have some discomfort then slow to a speed walk. I have no issue with the thought of pushing through pain, but because I just jumped into it, I want to make sure I prevent shin splints and (potentially?) stress fractures. At this time, I can finish a mile (running and walking) in about 12 minutes, and can speed walk a mile in less than 14 minutes. I am working to decrease these numbers as safely as possible.

Unfortunately, most of the outdoor surfaces I run on are concrete. I do go to the gym once or twice a week to run on a treadmill.

I am building up my water intake, I have tried different stretches before I go run/walk, and I have iced my shin a few times (albeit not consistently).

So… my question is… what is (typically) normal to feel in your legs while running?

&lt;p&gt;I (F/35) am new to running - new to consistent exercise in general. June 29 I just up and did a mile (running and walking) - and have done a mile (run/walk) or 2 mile (speed walk) every day since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I run/walk the mile, I will run/jog until my lower leg begins to have some discomfort then slow to a speed walk. I have no issue with the thought of pushing through pain, but because I just jumped into it, I want to make sure I prevent shin splints and (potentially?) stress fractures. At this time, I can finish a mile (running and walking) in about 12 minutes, and can speed walk a mile in less than 14 minutes. I am working to decrease these numbers as safely as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most of the outdoor surfaces I run on are concrete. I do go to the gym once or twice a week to run on a treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am building up my water intake, I have tried different stretches before I go run/walk, and I have iced my shin a few times (albeit not consistently).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So… my question is… what is (typically) normal to feel in your legs while running?
Also, are there any other tips/suggestions you can throw at me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

Just curious about the differing opinions on when to stop a cut

I've gone back into a deficit for 7-8 weeks now and gone form 75kg to 71kg (fluctuating between 71-72). 

Inbody showing I'm at 15 but calipers and measurements are a little lower (all be it I know me taking my own measurements 
probably aren't too accurate)

I'm happy to keep going at 1700-1800kcal but I'm starting to get back to that grouchy grumpy sleepy tired brain fog stage again due toy activity levels (Les mills instructor and lift 4 times a week)

But I feel if I keep going I'm just going to get skinny due to the lack of my muscle mass.

I have historically had good success doing workout classes, CrossFit, yoga classes, really anything social.

Problem is now I live in a much more rural place without the same access to IRL classes.

I have basic hand weights etc and access to streaming videos, but I can’t seem to consistently motivate myself to “get after it” well, all by myself at my house.

I’ve tried sticker charts etc and I get on a good run for awhile, but after a few weeks of no outside accountability, I always fall off.

Any tips or ideas?

,fitness30plus,"I'm starting to get a little frustrated.

I went from 171 to 151 in around 60 days. Was looking forward to breaking into the 140s.  
Now I slowly seem to be gaining the weight back (currently at 156) and I have no clue why.

My caloric deficit is -750 cal.  
My nutrition is sound. I food prep at the beginning of the week &amp; stick to it. Lots of salmon, beans, and veggies like broccoli or brussel sprouts.  
I used to drink 1/2 gallon (or more) of water per day, but did fall off that a bit.  
I stop eating 1-2 hours before bed.  
I hit the gym 4-5x per week. Cardio + resistance training organized by my online trainer.  
I do ballet and/or conditioning 5x per week.  
My rest days are my rest days. Sometimes doing some light stretching and walking at a park.

I know it could be:

* Muscle
* Hormones
* Digestion
* My carb intake

&lt;p&gt;I went from 171 to 151 in around 60 days. Was looking forward to breaking into the 140s.&lt;br/&gt;
Now I slowly seem to be gaining the weight back (currently at 156) and I have no clue why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My caloric deficit is -750 cal.&lt;br/&gt;
My nutrition is sound. I food prep at the beginning of the week &amp;amp; stick to it. Lots of salmon, beans, and veggies like broccoli or brussel sprouts.&lt;br/&gt;
I used to drink 1/2 gallon (or more) of water per day, but did fall off that a bit.&lt;br/&gt;
I stop eating 1-2 hours before bed.&lt;br/&gt;
I hit the gym 4-5x per week. Cardio + resistance training organized by my online trainer.&lt;br/&gt;
I do ballet and/or conditioning 5x per week.&lt;br/&gt;
My rest days are my rest days. Sometimes doing some light stretching and walking at a park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it could be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muscle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hormones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digestion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My carb intake&lt;/li&gt;

,fitness30plus,"I’ve been taking getting in the best shape of my life seriously before my 40th. 
Since the beginning of this year I’ve started Muay Thai, BJJ and boxing. Got might diet sorted by eating at a deficit between 1600 - 1800 calories and hit 160g protein minimum. I train predominantly with kettlebell at home and run. 

As I am getting older recovery is the hardest part. In the beginning I tried running everyday ended up with Achilles tendinitis. 
I was doing 2 boxing sessions a week and 2 Muay Thai sessions a week. But not lifting. 


Some weeks I only run once and most weeks I only go to one boxing lesson or skip boxing altogether. But I go to two Muay Thai classes and have started BJJ at one class a week.


I missed lifting so cut running down to 1-2 times a week. I have been following Geoff Nupert’s Easy Muscle Program went from 24KG bells to 32KG’s which are still a struggle. 

This is one of my all time favourite programs it’s 3 days a week. Only 30 mins and includes Pull ups and dips. I have ran this program over and over again and always come back to it. 

I have just completed this program with 32KG bells for the first time and want to have a deload before running something else from him or running it again. 

I am a sucker for routine and when ever I stop lifting or following a program I have a tendency to fart arse about and end up taking an extended break and self sabotage. 

So what would you recommend for a deload still lifting 3 days a week with my martial arts and cardio schedule. 

Do I need a deload? Should I focus more on body weight and callisthenics is one week enough before re running the same program?

I was thinking of using a week or two to focus more on skills I don’t do so often so swings , snatches and TGU as my program is clean and press and squat focused. I am also interested in learning callisthenics and can do a mediocre Lsit and want to get frog stand and pistol squats under my belt.

Hi everyone,

I recently turned 30 and have been dedicated to strength training for the past two years. On average, I lift around 20-25k volume per workout, which takes about 2 hours. I enjoy the pump, the soreness, and how it makes me feel, so I try to hit the gym 7 days a week.

However, I’ve noticed something strange. On weekends, I often go to the park or do outdoor activities with my toddler, and it completely drains my energy. Even though it's not as physically demanding as my training program, I find myself needing to crash on the couch for 30-40 minutes when we get back home.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Any tips or insights would be greatly appreciated!

,fitness30plus,"Hi everyone. I (f32) am wondering if anyone has had any success in achieving weight loss without using a calorie counter? For context, in 2019 I lost nearly 2 stone using myfitnesspal which I managed to keep off using the app for a further 3 years. I had to stop using the app as it was creating a huge amount of food anxiety and I was developing what I would say were disordered eating habits. I did fine without it for about a year but then fell into a dark place in life and stopped caring for myself. Now I'm a bit stuck on how to shift the weight again as I don't want to go back to logging due to the negative effects on my mental health over time.

,fitness30plus,"I had a major surgery about 2.5 years ago now. Before that I had lost about 4 stone, going from being very overweight to a very healthy weight. I worked out lots going to classes and the gym, I’d kept this up for a long time as well so it wasn’t a phase. 

After my major surgery it’s left me with some complications - one I can’t lift anything heavy. Two - sometimes I feel quite depressed. I have also started fostering a wonderful young boy as well, so have way less time than usual. 

By the end of the evening, I usually feel too tired to cook and order something or we have stuff quick and shit like pizza or noodles. Our young lad came to us with a very restricted diet anyway so it’s hard sometimes to think I’ll cook for us and for him, so we often end up having what he’s having. 

I’m hungry all the time and I’m not sure if that’s an emotional thing, but I snack throughout the day. 

I’ve put on 2 stone since my surgery and it’s not helping me with how I’m feeling about myself. Every single day I get up and think this is a new day, I’ll start eating healthy, and by mid day I’m snacking or if I go all day, I eat shit for dinner. 

I do need to get back to the gym but I don’t really know what I could do without things like squats, push ups, sit ups - they all cause pelvic floor pressure which I’m not allowed to do.

Here is my progress after a year of lifting and tracking calories.  You guys helped me get started and keep me committed when it gets easy to stop.  Looking for any thoughts, advice, encouragement, etc.

The first three pictures are before starting, the last three were a week ago.

I’m 39, 5’11”, 185lbs.  A year ago I was 190lbs, cut down to 175lbs, bulked up to 190 lbs, cut down to 180lbs and am working towards bulking up to 195lbs before cutting my back to 185lbs again.

My routine has varied but I’m currently doing BJJ 2 days a week, full body lifting 3 days a week, and hitting 10-12K steps daily.

The hardest part of this was the second cut where I was operating on 1700 calories. Sapped on strength and energy, took a diet break and then moved back to bulking.

My fear is bulking too fast and feeling full/bloated all the time but I’m trying to trust the process.

,fitness30plus,"Ok so long story short. I've (F36) been working out for two and a bit years. Before this I wasn't very active. I started weightlifting and weighed 54kg (very skinny, my height is 177 cm). I have gained about 20kg since then, most of it muscle, now weighing in at 73kg. Being completely green I started working out with a PT twice a week. My routine with him then and on my own now is two days a week full body resistance training (Monday or Tuesday + Thursday or friday) and one day running on the treadmill in between the resistance training days. The problem is I am pretty much always really sore for a day or two after the weight lifting, and it would be difficult to do any more days as my muscles are so sore. It doesn't seem like I'm getting more used to it either, and the day after I work out I usually feel really tired.

My split is I usually try to do two to three leg exercises (squats + something unilateral, bulgarians, variations of lunges + hip thrust or rdls), and an exercise for each upper body muscle group (back, chest, shoulders). I have a handful of different exercises for each of these too that I variate with. I try to progressively overload, but I feel like I've hit a plateau where I struggle to progress any more. I'm usually in the gym for 1,5 to 2 hours, with warmup for half an hour included in that.
My diet is OK-ish, I don't track my food very well but I eat as much as I can and also have some protein powder on the recovery days + right after a work out.

So my question is why am I always so sore? I've heard that DOMS doesn't necessarily equate muscle growth. I also struggle a bit with understanding hypertrophy in combination with reps and adding weight, like endurance vs muscle mass.

,fitness30plus,"So yesterday worked out pretty hard. 
Nothing crazy though but lasted about 2 hours 30 as soent an hour filming shoulder workouts for content then about 45 min leg work then another 45 min loaded mobility.

Feel fine 
Come around 10pm I notice I'm feeling extremely high energy, not tired at all. Almost like I drank too much coffee. End up not feeling tired til 3am and find it difficult to sleep. My body feels achy.

Couldn't sleep much either. Just feeling generally achy. Like I used to when I would do BJJ after a long break and go too hard.

But I didn't feel like I overtrained? 

Funny enough this happened about 10 days ago after a long workout! The same amped up feeling befor bed!

The thing is I did similar long workouts the days following and felt fine. 

Only thing I can think of is I was working from home this week, so barely any exercise from Sunday to the workout yesterday. I still did pushups and squats at home though. 

Did my body really lose the adaptation that quick? 

I trained BJJ since I was 15 weights and gymnastics since I was 13 ,I'm 33 now. 


Another thing I can think of... maybe my aerobic system is off? Last time I had this regular I had terrible aerobic fitness, could be why I feel so stimulated?

,fitness30plus,"Hi,

  
I am a 32-year-old woman. I never used to exercise, but had always been slim. I mostly only walked and hiked because that is something I enjoyed and did yoga sometimes.

A couple of years ago, I started doing ballet one hour a week, and after one year I realized my legs looked and felt stronger, which motivated me to start going to the gym. For the first time in my life, I started exercising ""seriously"".

For the last year, I have increased to two hours of ballet per week plus 2 to 3 days of weight training. The way I train is through group classes (HIIT or Crossfit). I like the way I feel. I feel stronger, I have more endurance, I can hike better, I feel challenged... the problem is... I hate the way my body looks now.

  
I had always been slim, with a narrow frame and slightly curvy. My height is 164 and my weight was usually around 49 kgs. I had a narrow waist (62 cm) and my hip area was 90 cms. I was not athletic, my body was not super firm, but I liked the way it looked. Even when I gained a bit of weight, my weight would go around my thighs and hips, and it looked soft and curvy, if that makes sense. I still liked it.

Since I have been working out, my body is different. My legs have become thicker, which I am ok with, but  my waist is also thicker (67 cms). My hips have remained the same, so I look less curvy. Overall, my body looks thicker. I don´t know how to explain it, is not fat, because when I have gained a bit of weight in the past it looked kind of soft. This looks more like dense and bloated, like my whole body is about to burst. Nothing in my diet has changed.

,fitness30plus,"So for twenty one years of lifting I've avoided the treadmill. I'd rely on other sports like basketball and swimming for my cardio. But now I'm pushing 40 in a few years and I don't have any other sport anymore. My metabolism has slowed down as well. So I have no choice but start using the treadmill and cycling machines. But my main problem is it's so damn boring.

I've gotten about eight out of the last workout days with post workout cardio (I don't use them after leg days) and I noticed that watching YouTube videos makes me not notice the time. Now just to shake it up a bit are there any apps that can similarly help me not notice the time pass while I'm getting my steps in? Appreciate all suggestions!

Not that I wasn't going to compete if something fun came up and was local. (For example, a Pro/AM competition that was fairly local that I ended up taking 2nd place in the U105 class and bringing home $550)\nThe big goal was to actual commit to a real bulk. I would sign up for competitions within my weight class, U90/U200, and in return never have a true off season where I could try and add mass and body weight. So, when I did compete, I competed at whatever I weighed in at. This was actually really nice as I felt stronger going into competitions and was still competitive at a decently high level.\nI wanted one of my main focuses to be bringing up my subpar (in my weight class) deadlift to try and be more competitive at the national and world levels.\n\nIn true dreamer bulk status (99% fairly clean) I was in a large surplus. I wanted to take advantage of that large surplus so I programmed up a nasty high effort program based off of the Ed Coan Deadlift program.\n\n**Diet:**\nUsually, 4,000+ calories a day. I counted the first week just to get a rough estimate and then nothing was measured after that.\nProtein: made sure I was getting 200 grams a day at the minimum.\nDid not track or care about the other macros. I'm not a macro guy.\n\n*Example day of diet:*\n\n**Breakfast:**\nMixed in a bowl\nServing of fat free cottage cheese\nServing of fat free Greek yogurt\nServing of pumpkin seeds\nServing of walnuts\nServing of chia seeds\nServing of flax seeds\n1 Banana\nServing of honey\n\n**Snack 1:**\nBagel with peanut butter\n\n**Lunch 1:**\nChicken breast\nServing of Brussell sprouts\nserving of egg white noodles\n\n**Snack 2:**\nBagel with peanut butter\n\n**Lunch 2:**\nChicken breast\nServing of Brussell sprouts\nserving of egg white noodles\n\n**Snack 3:**\nBagel with peanut butter\n\n**Preworkout meal:**\nProtein shake (just protein powder and water)\nBanana\n\n**Dinner:**\nWe get Hello Fresh boxes so it's not an exact science, but the general idea is:\n2 servings of meat\n2 servings of carbs\n2 servings of vegetables\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday I would usually take a break and just put an entire bag of frozen chicken nuggets and frozen fries in the oven and eat that over Saturday/Sunday. Hello Fresh for dinners as usual. These two days were actually lighter calorie wise. It was nice to graze throughout the day and unstuff myself.\n\n**Programming:**\n\n*Monday:*\nEd Coan Deadlift program, but with OHP instead\n\n*Tuesday:*\nEd Coan Deadlift program\n\n*Wednesday:*\nLight leg day for recovery\n\n*Thursday:*\nStrongman Event Day training\n\n*Friday:*\nEd Coan Deadlift program, but with Incline Bench\n\n*Saturday:*\nEd Coan Deadlift program, but with Front Squats\n\n*Sunday:*\nBiceps and forearms\n\nLift choices and rational:\n\n**Monday:**\n\nMain:\nStrict Press/Push Press\n\nOther:\nBehind the neck press\nMore Strict Press\nUpright Rows\nRolling Tricep Extensions\nOverhead Extensions\nLateral Raises\nFront Raises\nRear delt raises\n\nResults:\n285 x 2 ---&gt; 300 x 2 Push Press (Low RPE, probably could have done 5-6 reps)\n255 x 2 ---&gt; 265 x 2 Strict Press\n280 strict press ---&gt; 285 Strict Press\n225 BTN ---&gt; 250 BTN\n\nNotes:\nAt first, I had decided that push press would be my main lift, but I got the urge about halfway through to push my strict press a bit more. Because of that I did both strict press as a main lift and as back down sets.\n\nBasically, I would strict press any weights that I could and if I couldn't, I would switch over to push press. This worked well and I will do this more often.\n\nThis was the longest and hardest day of the week, but I recover super fast from tricep/shoulder/overhead lifts, so I really pushed the volume on these days.\n\nNothing more to report from this day!\n\n\n**Tuesday:**\n\nMain:\nDeadlift\n\nOther:\nPower Shrugs\nStiff Legged/RDL\nGood Mornings/Snatch Grip RDL\nLat Pulldowns\nCable Rows\n\n\nResults:\n\n600 deadlift ---&gt; 620 deadlift (sad)\n\nNote:\nI ran this as designed in the original Ed Coan program.\n\nThe deadlifts themselves always felt light and the accessories felt horrible to get through. I only do good mornings with an SSB bar, so when I did them at home or the office gym, I replaced them with snatch grip deadlifts.\n\nThe stiff legged deadlifts got really taxing later on in the programming and I switched them over for RDL's. The combo of heavy deadlifts, shrugs, stiff legged, and good mornings was brutal.\nReplacing the stiff legged with RDL's and the good mornings with Snatch Grip RDL felt like it hit the same muscle groups but was much less taxing and I preferred that.\n\n\n**Wednesday:**\nLeg extensions\nLeg curls\nHip adb/add machine\nCalf Raise Machine\n\nNotes:\nI started very light on these and did 50 reps each. As long as I could do those 50 reps within 5 sets, I increased the weight by 5 pounds. If it took me more than five sets, I kept the weight the same until it didn't.\n\nNothing to report here other than it was good for me to actually do these. I basically do zero leg accessories outside of squats.\n\n**Thursday:**\nLog/Axle (You guessed it, Ed Coan programming for these)\nFarmers\nYoke or Yoke Zercher\nSandbag work\n\nResults:\nMostly didn't test any of this.\n\nLog Clean and Press Every Rep: 285 x 2\n\nNotes:\nThis would change a lot depending on if I had a competition coming up. I'm a strong believer that if you don't have a competition coming up for Strongman you should stay in good practice with log, farmers, and sandbags. Anything else that comes up is easy to train and builds off of those other events.\n\n**Friday:**\n\nMain:\nIncline Bench (paused)\n\nOther:\nDips\nChest Flys\nPush Ups\n\nResults:\n\n275 ---&gt; 325 Incline Bench (paused)\n+50 pounds in 10 weeks\n\nNotes:\n\nI hurt my shoulder in a competition in Jan. and flat bench no longer agrees with me. It took a bit of testing, but the lifts you see here are the only things that didn't bother my shoulder.\n\nI was adding weight to pushups, but after a little it gave me the same issue as flat bench. Body weight gave me no issue, so I went back to that.\n\nI kept the pause on the bench just because I figured it probably had some good carry over to OHP from a dead stop.\n\n**Saturday:**\n\nMain:\nFront Squats\n\nOther:\nBack Squats\nBarbell Split Squats\nDB Lunges/Trap bar lunges\nDB Split Squats/Trap bar split squats\nDB Goblet Squat/Barbell Close stance squats\n\nResults:\n\n425 ---&gt; 475 Front Squat\n(very proud of this one)\n\nNotes:\n\nI do front squats because they have good carry over to strongman events and they also hurt me the least out of any squat.\nHigh bar hurts my lower back because I have a forward lean.\nLow bar feels good on my back but hurts my elbows and wrists.\nFront Squat hurts nothing!\n\nI also figured if I added weight to my front squats while continuing to do high bar back squats as an accessory lift that naturally my high bar back squat would increase. As soon as I hit 500 with my front squat, I'll test that theory!\n\nThe single leg stuff was brutal at first but got much better and even easy as I continued. I think it was something that I was missing out on.\n\n**Sunday:**\n\n5k recovery run (slow 10-minute a mile pace)\nBarbell Curl\nBarbell Reverse Curl\nDB Curl\nWrist Curls\nForearm roller work\n\nSame exact idea as Wednesday. Started too light and added five pounds. I've been sandbagging biceps as I got pretty decent at these!\n\n**Everyday:**\n\nI did 50 reps of core and back extensions 6/7 days of the week. On Sundays I didn't do any core work. More for a mental break than anything else.\n\nI rotated through core work like this:\nMonday: Hanging Leg Raises\nTuesday: Side Bends\nWednesday: Ab Crunch Machine\nThursday: Russian Twists\nFriday: Ab Crunch Machine\nSaturday: Ab Wheel Roll outs\n\n**Body weight change:**\n199 ---&gt; 213 pounds (overshot my goal of 210 by a little, but it's starting to even out now)\n\n**Measurement changes:**\nThese will be revealed in an additional 10 weeks!\n\n**Upcoming programming:**\nMag Ort Deadlift (Except for I do it for everything!)\nI also have been tempted to do 100 pull ups Monday through Friday for a while so that's on the agenda as well. (Saturday and Sunday I work out from home, and I don't have a pull up set up, so I'm thinking body weight rows on the barbell instead as a nice little recovery)\n\nAnother ten weeks of bulking with 220 being the end goal.\n\n**Notes/Thoughts:**\nMost accessories were kept light and gradually increased week after week. As weight went up the reps went down accordingly. On others I simply did 50 reps in as few sets as possible.\n\nBeing able to eat normally has been great. (This is how hungry I usually am!) Rarely did I go into a workout feeling drained like I would if I was maintaining or cutting.\n\nSleep: I sleep poorly, but I took this just as serious as training. I was sleeping somewhere between 5 and 5 and a half hours per night prior to this. I managed to increase it to about 6.5 to 7 hours during this time frame.\nI mostly focused on getting in bed at the right time and just making things quiet and dark. Even if that meant scolding my wife for her nightly computer work in bed. Earphones with ASMR and sleep masks helped keep me out of spousal fights oversleep.\nAnother big thing I discovered was if I ate before I went to bed (which if often did) I would sleep horrible. Making sure there was about 3 hours before the last thing I ate and when I laid down was a game changer.\n\nI've been missing out on doing heavier work for the majority of my lifting. It apparently has worked really well and was exactly what I needed to add some strength!\n\nI was often beat up in the lower back and hips, but to be expected with how I was lifting. The daily back extensions and curls helped greatly.\n\nLifting 7 days a week has been great and I'm happy I'm doing it. None of the days seem to interfere with each other except for on Thursday I could feel fatigue in my hamstrings whenever I did sandbag carrying. This should make sandbags feel great in competitions when I've deloaded!\n\nIt was fun and I'm excited to Frankenstein more programming in the future. During my cuts I'll take a more submaximal approach like 531 FSL 5x5 with a CrossFit workout of the day in place of accessories.\n\nWhile my deadlift saw minimal results compared to the other lifts, I don't think it's all because of the programming. I think I'm still learning the best way to deadlift for my leverages. I often drop my hips too low, shorten my arms by flexing them, and am slow off the floor. I've gotten lots of feedback on my programming and I think I will see a better PR in the next 10 weeks.\n\n"", 'author_fullname': 't2_1rd5qvdw', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'The Ed Coan Everything (Deadlift) Review ', 'link_flair_richtext': [{'e': 'text', 't': 'Program Review'}], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/weightroom', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': '', 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_1duby9q', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': None, 'upvote_ratio': 0.97, 'author_flair_background_color': '#d3d6da', 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 100, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': '162cffec-05ca-11e1-a30a-12313d18857a', 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'Program Review', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 100, 'approved_by': None, 'is_created_from_ads_ui': False, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [{'e': 'text', 't': 'Mr. Arm Squats'}], 'gildings': {}, 'post_hint': 'self', 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1720005856.0, 'link_flair_type': 'richtext', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'richtext', 'domain': 'self.weightroom', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the Ed Coan Deadlift program. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://stoicperformance.com/blogs/workout-routines/ed-coan-deadlift-routine""&gt;https://stoicperformance.com/blogs/workout-routines/ed-coan-deadlift-routine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine this, but for every day just replacing the lifts with different lifts/muscle groups.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the first time ever, I decided to commit to having an actual off season for strongman. Not that I wasn&amp;#39;t going to compete if something fun came up and was local. (For example, a Pro/AM competition that was fairly local that I ended up taking 2nd place in the U105 class and bringing home $550)\nThe big goal was to actual commit to a real bulk. I would sign up for competitions within my weight class, U90/U200, and in return never have a true off season where I could try and add mass and body weight. So, when I did compete, I competed at whatever I weighed in at. This was actually really nice as I felt stronger going into competitions and was still competitive at a decently high level.\nI wanted one of my main focuses to be bringing up my subpar (in my weight class) deadlift to try and be more competitive at the national and world levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In true dreamer bulk status (99% fairly clean) I was in a large surplus. I wanted to take advantage of that large surplus so I programmed up a nasty high effort program based off of the Ed Coan Deadlift program.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diet:&lt;/strong&gt;\nUsually, 4,000+ calories a day. I counted the first week just to get a rough estimate and then nothing was measured after that.\nProtein: made sure I was getting 200 grams a day at the minimum.\nDid not track or care about the other macros. I&amp;#39;m not a macro guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example day of diet:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakfast:&lt;/strong&gt;\nMixed in a bowl\nServing of fat free cottage cheese\nServing of fat free Greek yogurt\nServing of pumpkin seeds\nServing of walnuts\nServing of chia seeds\nServing of flax seeds\n1 Banana\nServing of honey&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snack 1:&lt;/strong&gt;\nBagel with peanut butter&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lunch 1:&lt;/strong&gt;\nChicken breast\nServing of Brussell sprouts\nserving of egg white noodles&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snack 2:&lt;/strong&gt;\nBagel with peanut butter&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lunch 2:&lt;/strong&gt;\nChicken breast\nServing of Brussell sprouts\nserving of egg white noodles&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snack 3:&lt;/strong&gt;\nBagel with peanut butter&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preworkout meal:&lt;/strong&gt;\nProtein shake (just protein powder and water)\nBanana&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dinner:&lt;/strong&gt;\nWe get Hello Fresh boxes so it&amp;#39;s not an exact science, but the general idea is:\n2 servings of meat\n2 servings of carbs\n2 servings of vegetables&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Saturday and Sunday I would usually take a break and just put an entire bag of frozen chicken nuggets and frozen fries in the oven and eat that over Saturday/Sunday. Hello Fresh for dinners as usual. These two days were actually lighter calorie wise. It was nice to graze throughout the day and unstuff myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monday:&lt;/em&gt;\nEd Coan Deadlift program, but with OHP instead&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuesday:&lt;/em&gt;\nEd Coan Deadlift program&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wednesday:&lt;/em&gt;\nLight leg day for recovery&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thursday:&lt;/em&gt;\nStrongman Event Day training&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friday:&lt;/em&gt;\nEd Coan Deadlift program, but with Incline Bench&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saturday:&lt;/em&gt;\nEd Coan Deadlift program, but with Front Squats&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sunday:&lt;/em&gt;\nBiceps and forearms&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lift choices and rational:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Main:\nStrict Press/Push Press&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other:\nBehind the neck press\nMore Strict Press\nUpright Rows\nRolling Tricep Extensions\nOverhead Extensions\nLateral Raises\nFront Raises\nRear delt raises&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Results:\n285 x 2 ---&amp;gt; 300 x 2 Push Press (Low RPE, probably could have done 5-6 reps)\n255 x 2 ---&amp;gt; 265 x 2 Strict Press\n280 strict press ---&amp;gt; 285 Strict Press\n225 BTN ---&amp;gt; 250 BTN&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notes:\nAt first, I had decided that push press would be my main lift, but I got the urge about halfway through to push my strict press a bit more. Because of that I did both strict press as a main lift and as back down sets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, I would strict press any weights that I could and if I couldn&amp;#39;t, I would switch over to push press. This worked well and I will do this more often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was the longest and hardest day of the week, but I recover super fast from tricep/shoulder/overhead lifts, so I really pushed the volume on these days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing more to report from this day!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Main:\nDeadlift&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other:\nPower Shrugs\nStiff Legged/RDL\nGood Mornings/Snatch Grip RDL\nLat Pulldowns\nCable Rows&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;600 deadlift ---&amp;gt; 620 deadlift (sad)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note:\nI ran this as designed in the original Ed Coan program.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The deadlifts themselves always felt light and the accessories felt horrible to get through. I only do good mornings with an SSB bar, so when I did them at home or the office gym, I replaced them with snatch grip deadlifts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The stiff legged deadlifts got really taxing later on in the programming and I switched them over for RDL&amp;#39;s. The combo of heavy deadlifts, shrugs, stiff legged, and good mornings was brutal.\nReplacing the stiff legged with RDL&amp;#39;s and the good mornings with Snatch Grip RDL felt like it hit the same muscle groups but was much less taxing and I preferred that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday:&lt;/strong&gt;\nLeg extensions\nLeg curls\nHip adb/add machine\nCalf Raise Machine&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notes:\nI started very light on these and did 50 reps each. As long as I could do those 50 reps within 5 sets, I increased the weight by 5 pounds. If it took me more than five sets, I kept the weight the same until it didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing to report here other than it was good for me to actually do these. I basically do zero leg accessories outside of squats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday:&lt;/strong&gt;\nLog/Axle (You guessed it, Ed Coan programming for these)\nFarmers\nYoke or Yoke Zercher\nSandbag work&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Results:\nMostly didn&amp;#39;t test any of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Log Clean and Press Every Rep: 285 x 2&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notes:\nThis would change a lot depending on if I had a competition coming up. I&amp;#39;m a strong believer that if you don&amp;#39;t have a competition coming up for Strongman you should stay in good practice with log, farmers, and sandbags. Anything else that comes up is easy to train and builds off of those other events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Main:\nIncline Bench (paused)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other:\nDips\nChest Flys\nPush Ups&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;275 ---&amp;gt; 325 Incline Bench (paused)\n+50 pounds in 10 weeks&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hurt my shoulder in a competition in Jan. and flat bench no longer agrees with me.

,fitness30plus,"I’ve seen a lot of posts asking about injury risk around deadlifts and questioning whether it’s worth it to do them so I figured I’d share my story around them. 

7 years ago I was in my early 40s and had a ‘bad back’. Every few months I’d bend over to pick something up, tie my shoe, or just move wrong and my back would lock up. I’d have a couple of days of struggling to get out of bed and a couple of weeks of lingering pain and then a few months later the cycle would repeat. It sucked! And babying my back only seemed to make it worse. 

I was lifting weights, but I was avoiding deadlifts and squats because of the ‘risk’, but after spending some time over in /r/weightroom and listening to their ‘anti-glassback’ talk I figured I would give them a spin. 

So I started super light - 5x5’s at 65lbs (the bar + 10lbs/side). And I progressed slowly - only when I could easily hit a 5x5 did I add 10lbs. And I never maxed out. 

And slowly my back got better. The intervals between incidents got longer and longer and I recovered quicker (partly because I figured out the cure for back tweaks is to keep moving and do a ton of super light deadlifts). 

These days I’m pushing 50 and my back is bulletproof. I can’t remember the last time I tweaked it (despite adding in heavy triples and singles a few years back), and I’m strong AF - 405lbs is an easy 5x5 for me. And within the past few months I’ve hit [a triple at 495lbs](https://streamable.com/1hwk4t) and a [2in deficit single at 515lbs](https://streamable.com/j2pamd). 

So, if your back’s bothering you, maybe give deadlifts a shot. Start out light and progress slowly.

,fitness30plus,"Hi all. Glad I found this sub.

So I'm a 37 year old man. Always had been athletic and in good shape... that is until I met my wife and gained wait through domestic bliss lol.

I'm 5'10"" and when I was in ""good"" shape I was around 180 lbs. No six pack but still very toned and clothes fit well.

Currently I'm around 220 lbs and really wanting to get back to my former self. 

So a couple things im working on...
1. I have binge eating disorder but have gotten a new medication that is helping. I'm much better at controlling it.

2. I've been focusing more on calorie deficits vs super healthy foods. I know both are important but I have 2 kids under 2 years old so it's very hard to cook. Calorie deficits based on TDEE estimates.

3. Exercise. I love my Peloton. I tend to ride 4x a week and then doing a 15 minute strength training exercise through their app. I burn about 350 to 500 calories (estimated) per workout session.

I'd love to be around 15% body fat. For a healthy physique but really to just be a healthier man. I'm an older dad so I want to be active with my kids. I've read that 15% is achievable but unsure if it's true and if I need to make much bigger changes to my current activities.

I’m embarrassed to even ask because there’s so much going on in that unicorn of a routine. However, as I get older (42 in 9 days), I don’t need to bench press or squat what I did when I was 25+. Having muscles feels good and looks good (I’m sure many of our wives/husbands/significant others would agree), and I’m all for having a muscular build, but it doesn’t have to be a beach body. I’ll take healthy and strong over the type of body I may have gone for prior to marriage and kids. 


Now, I’m much more interested in a balanced approach that keeps me strong, but also leaves time for the other qualities mentioned in the title. If I may be dramatic for a second, if the world ended tomorrow, I’d want to be strong/flexible/functional/capable enough to do what I needed to do. Focusing on what I focused on in college wouldn’t necessarily get me there. I’ve briefly read about the 4-2-1 method (4 strength sessions per week, 2 cardio, and 1 mobility) and that piqued my interest, but I’m curious if any routine exists that hits all of those mentioned above?

,fitness30plus,"Hi everyone. First of all, I'm sorry if some of the things I'm going to ask seem very basic or silly, I'm kind of new in doing proper and organized training. So here it goes:

I'm F32 and 160cm (I think that's about 5'2) and currently weight about 51kg (which is about 113lbs). I've been trying to do body recomp for the past year and a half, which made me lose a lot of fat weight (I think in the past 2 years I lost about 8-10kg of fat just by changing a few habits). I'm currently trying to focus on gaining muscle, which I haven't been able to do too much, I've just pretty much maintained my muscle while losing fat. (I know all of this because of anthropometrics done by a nutritionist).

The current type of workout I found I enjoy is in this gym which offers personalized functional training, and which I'm starting this month (previously I was doing functional personal training but with bodyweight mostly). I don't really know the broad definition of functional training but this is what they will make me do in my new gym: whole body workouts including things like squats and similar, things for legs and things for upper body, and they use elements like the use of dumbells of 2 and 3kg (4lbs and 6lbs) to start with, and the use of kettlebells of about 5kg (11lbs) to start with, sometimes TRX, sometimes ankle weights of 1kg to start with, sometimes an elastic band, and functional exercises in general.

Is it ok to do the whole-body functional training this way twice a week? is it healthy to do it even 3 times a week or is it too much for a whole body training like that?

Is it ok if I do one of those trainings Wednesday afternoon (430pm) and then the following one is Friday morning (8 or 10am)? or is that not enough time between sessions? That's the best I could do because of schedule but maybe I can try to move up the Wednesday one two hours earlier or so, as in 230pm.

I also go out biking about once a week.

I'll be sure to add the proper amount of protein to my diet as well.

My aim is to have more defined and toned look, especially in legs. And of course, gain muscle in general.

Do you think this type of training will help me archive my goal or doing strength training machine is a must?

We moved at the end of May so I totally missed a May update but it was A LOT of time in my truck driving back and forth moving stuff. We moved 1.5 hours from our previous town and our house STILL isn’t put back together since moving. There has been quite a bit of eating out so my diet hasn’t been consistent.
I HAVE been consistent with my workout and I feel better from that. I’m working through the MAPS Anabolic routine from the MindPump guys (love their podcast). Just finished the pre-phase and start Phase 1 this week.

I’ve gotten my meal prepping going again so I’m expecting to see more weight loss this next month. I am working on breaking my family out of the “eating out” rut we’ve developed as that will be healthier for all of us and better for helping me hit my macros.
My wife has been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis so I think a Mediterranean-style diet would be beneficial for her (low inflammatory). My daughter and I would benefit too because of the emphasis on whole-foods, healthy fats and healthy protein. That will be the direction I take for family suppers this month.
Breakfast will be 2 whole eggs, egg whites, veggies, and a low-carb tortilla. Lunch tends to be 6-8 oz of beef or chicken with veggies. I also eat about 1 cup of cottage cheese each day and a mixed-berry protein smoothie that I freeze and ice cream with our Ninja Creami.
My fitness pal puts me at 1500 calories per day with 160 G protein and 28 g fiber and supper left to plan/track. I expect I’ll hit around 2000 cal/day and 175g protein and 30 g fiber each day.

,fitness30plus,"Hi out there- I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed at the moment and I'm hoping some people out there might have a similar work setup and can share their experiences and maybe a few words of motivation with me...

I recently started a new position at work which has very long hours and a LOT of international travel. For example, in the 4 weeks since starting, I have been on 4 continents and 18 cities, with 7 days at home. As you can imagine, getting to all these places entails a lot of early mornings paired with late nights,not to mention considerable jetlag. While I'm traveling, it's pretty rare that I'll have unscheduled time. I'm averaging 4-5 hours of sleep, and I can't find much of a way to squeeze exercise in (although I have bought a jump rope which I'll start taking with me for a quick workout in the morning). At this point, while I'm on the road, I'm basically trying to just keep my calories under control, because that's about all I can really influence at this point. 

My strategy is to squeeze in as much gym time as possible when I'm not on the road. Since it can be weeks between stops at home, it's going to be hard to make a lot of progress, but at least I should be able to prevent myself from backsliding...right? 

So now my questions to you redditors: is anyone out there in a similar boat (or have you been in the past)? Any strategies for keeping fitness on the forefront? Any tips for not burning out?  Suggestions for maintaining a nutritious diet when you don't have much of a say over what you're eating, and no opportunity to cook?

,fitness30plus,"TLDR: I decided to get fit and healthy at 48. Instead, I got sick, but now after 4.5 years of effort, I'm slowly getting somewhere.

At the end of 2019, at age 48, I decided that the way I looked and felt was not how I wanted to proceed into my 50s, so I decided to turn my life around. In January 2020, I quit drinking, quit smoking, started working out and eat healthily. It was a lot, but I was highly motivated.

My body didn't like that. First, a frozen shoulder made any movements of my left arm pretty painful for about a year. So, I turned to bodyweight leg days and long walks. Then an autoimmune disease (Graves') hit me that leads to muscle weakness in the legs for a change (among many other things). That went undiagnosed for a long time during Covid. I could hardly climb stairs, had to sit down to put on my shoes, was permanently exhausted, and felt really old.

So, what do you do when you are elderly  and trying to get fit? I decided to give some gentle yoga a try. I also got a heart rate tracker. Then I threw the heart rate tracker away like the piece of garbage I thought it was for showing crazy numbers. Because you just can't have a heart rate of about 180 (or whatever it was, I don't remember) when doing child's pose, right? That would be crazy. But the tracker was probably right, I was off. 

After I had moved countries, a health check-up for the new insurance accidentially led to a proper diagnosis and I was put on medication. Things began to improve from there. I got myself a set of kettlebells, found a good yoga teacher, went swimming, cycling, and walked more. On the downside, the medication led to severe weight gain over the next 18 months. In June 2023, after 3.5 years of a ""healthy lifestyle,"" my body weight was back to its worst. 

With the medication on a low dose by then, I figured I could try to fight the weight off now, and it worked well. I started counting my calories somewhat randomly at 1500 cals/day, later upping this to 1700-1850 cals. I lost 23kg / 50 lbs over one year (most of it during the first 6 months, though, not much happening at 1850 cals). I would have preferred to get down another 5kg/10lbs, but I'm also happy with this outcome for now. 

Now my plan is to stay on maintenance calories (around 2100-2200, it seems) for a while and trying to ""maingain"". My training routine is to do 1 hour of ""something"" every day on average at least. That includes 2-3 kettlebell and ring workouts (45-60 minutes each) per week. The rest is yoga, walking, cycling, and swimming.

&lt;p&gt;So, what do you do when you are elderly  and trying to get fit? I decided to give some gentle yoga a try. I also got a heart rate tracker. Then I threw the heart rate tracker away like the piece of garbage I thought it was for showing crazy numbers. Because you just can&amp;#39;t have a heart rate of about 180 (or whatever it was, I don&amp;#39;t remember) when doing child&amp;#39;s pose, right? That would be crazy. But the tracker was probably right, I was off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I had moved countries, a health check-up for the new insurance accidentially led to a proper diagnosis and I was put on medication. Things began to improve from there. I got myself a set of kettlebells, found a good yoga teacher, went swimming, cycling, and walked more. On the downside, the medication led to severe weight gain over the next 18 months. In June 2023, after 3.5 years of a &amp;quot;healthy lifestyle,&amp;quot; my body weight was back to its worst. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the medication on a low dose by then, I figured I could try to fight the weight off now, and it worked well. I started counting my calories somewhat randomly at 1500 cals/day, later upping this to 1700-1850 cals. I lost 23kg / 50 lbs over one year (most of it during the first 6 months, though, not much happening at 1850 cals). I would have preferred to get down another 5kg/10lbs, but I&amp;#39;m also happy with this outcome for now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my plan is to stay on maintenance calories (around 2100-2200, it seems) for a while and trying to &amp;quot;maingain&amp;quot;. My training routine is to do 1 hour of &amp;quot;something&amp;quot; every day on average at least. That includes 2-3 kettlebell and ring workouts (45-60 minutes each) per week. The rest is yoga, walking, cycling, and swimming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry about the long post&lt;/p&gt;

Hey guys I’ve been off and on with dieting and the gym, but I’m really wanting to work hard to get in shape. I want to look better and be more confident to do things like go to the pool and beach, and I want to wear smaller clothes. 

If I start July 1 with a relatively effective dieting plan and relatively “easy” foray back into the gym, what can my realistic weight loss look like by mid September ~15 weeks or so? 

I’m not thinking an overly aggressive diet. I’m talking like 1500 calories a day, Whole Foods, water, no refined sugars or other bullshit. Fruits, veggies, complex carbs, nuts, etc. 

And for the gym I’m thinking low-intensity cardio and the weight machines at Planet Fitness. Nothing overly aggressive.

My macro breakdown is as follows

1920 calories

216g protein

91G net carbs

76.8 g fat

I used the Mifflin-St Jeor equation to find my my maintence TDEE which is about 2313 which was very close to the Katch-McArdle result using % body fat

I can see a result in the mirror, I have definitely slimmed down some but apparently have gained almost NO muscle mass in 3 months while making strength gains.

I have been consistently increasing my weights in the gym and track each lift every session so I know that is true, (Though my bench and squat suck and haven't improved much).  I am doing the free AthleanX PPL split from youtube which he says hits strength and hypertrophy, but I am not seeing the hypertrophy results

**Any thoughts on what I can do to ramp this up?  Should i switch to a more hypertrophy focused workout to get the increased mass I am looking for?**

Thanks

I will just tell you now I don't have a diet in place. I just am more aware of what I put in my body and don't worry because enjoyment of food is more important than fearing it. 

I have switched my workout regimen from heavy focus on back to heavy focus on legs/core. Usually I switch up every 4 months just to shock the body.

Wanted to get back in shape for my birthday, which was on the 17th of this month.

Started out by eating a serving of oatmeal, half a serving of blueberries and half a serving of chocolate peanut butter powder mixed in, a banana (I don't measure this), two servings of unsalted peanuts, one serving of dried edamame,  one serving of whole milk mixed with one serving of LEVELS unflavored protein powder and another half serving of chocolate peanut butter powder. I'd end the day with two slices of wheat bread with tuna and a spread of hummus with a serving of chobani yogurt. Over the duration, I ended up nixing a serving of peanuts, swapped to nonfat milk because the protein:calorie ratio is better, swapped to oikos yogurt for the same reason and cut my beloved bananas in the last two weeks (this was the most difficult).

,fitness30plus,"Late 30’s, two kids, travel for work a lot, golfer. I’ve been at it since September and basically took one month off to complete my masters in December. I’ve  had some small noticeable improvements and I can definitely move more weight than when I started but I’m just not seeing the physical growth I hoped to have gained. 

I’m 5’9 170, eat close to 160-170g of protein each day. I have usually 2 devoted leg days a week and try to sneak in a few extra sets on my other days. I try to get about 25 or more sets each week balanced between quads and ham/glutes. A typical day might be 4-6 sets of squats, 3-4 extensions, 3-4 leg curls, and leg press or DL. I try to get 12 calf sets each week as well. 

I’ve spent months going heavier with 4-6 reps squatting and recently trying 8-12 reps to see if that changes things. The other exercises I usually go around 10. Calves I’ve gone anywhere from 15 to failure and 25/failure (standing and sitting with weight).

My one hinderance is I need my right hip replaced (thanks skateboarding in my teen years) so going super deep on squats and other heavier lifts that put a lot of pressure on my hip can be a problem (currently get injected every 6 months until they stop working, then it’ll be replaced. Got the green light from Mayo Clinic).

I’ve been at it since September and basically took one month off to complete my masters in December. I’ve  had some small noticeable improvements and I can definitely move more weight than when I started but I’m just not seeing the physical growth I hoped to have gained. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m 5’9 170, eat close to 160-170g of protein each day. I have usually 2 devoted leg days a week and try to sneak in a few extra sets on my other days. I try to get about 25 or more sets each week balanced between quads and ham/glutes. A typical day might be 4-6 sets of squats, 3-4 extensions, 3-4 leg curls, and leg press or DL. I try to get 12 calf sets each week as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent months going heavier with 4-6 reps squatting and recently trying 8-12 reps to see if that changes things. The other exercises I usually go around 10. Calves I’ve gone anywhere from 15 to failure and 25/failure (standing and sitting with weight).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My one hinderance is I need my right hip replaced (thanks skateboarding in my teen years) so going super deep on squats and other heavier lifts that put a lot of pressure on my hip can be a problem (currently get injected every 6 months until they stop working, then it’ll be replaced. Got the green light from Mayo Clinic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to hear how anyone has improved their otherwise stubborn legs without TRT 😂&lt;/p&gt;

,fitness30plus,"I've been lifting consistently for 10 months. Just finished my cut. Both photos I'm about 168 lbs. 

I eat healthy and meal prep every week, hitting my macros daily, cheating occasionally but nothing crazy. 

I started out with a 6 day ppl for the first few months and then switched to a full body 3x a week just because my schedule is a bit crazy and I don't have a lot of extra time for the gym so I was trying to save some time. 

My bench went up from 145 lbs 5x5 to 180lbs 5x5.

Here is where I think i went wrong though and please don't criticize me too much in the comments, I'm just looking for some guidance. First thing is that I cannot get more sleep than 5.5 hours a night. I have 2 twin toddlers, a 7 year old and I work 12 hour days. I literally isn't possible for me to get more sleep than that, and I know that can play a big role in making gains. 

Second is, and I know, I know...
 I stopped working out my legs. Not because I want to look imbalanced, but because I told myself that I don't have a lot of time, so if I see results in my upper body after a year, then I'll start working out my legs but in the meantime why waste my time if I'm not making any progress anywhere else anyway? Stupid way of thinking, I know. Especially since I read that working out your legs releases growth hormones. 

Lastly, I never did deadlifts. So that's 2 compound exercises Ive been neglecting (deadlifts and squats).

Do you guys think that if I focused more this time  on my lower body, and started doing those compound lifts that'll I'll have some better results a year from now? ANY advice is appreciated. I'm extremely discouraged right now.

,fitness30plus,"As a preface to everything I've never been in shape or thin for any of my post childhood years. Recently started visiting weight management doctor who said I was a perfect candidate for bariatric which was enough to make me realize I had to fix some shit because there's no way I'm doing that. So here we are about 3 months into post health focus and my 1st week of trying to get into fitness. Started at 310 and lost most of my weight early on and the coasting at 290ish inspired me to add another aspect into my routine.

I'm cheap, a shit in, hate clutter, and have very little room so my beginning focus will be body weight exercises, resistance bands, and a little under desk pedal station. All is going smoothly except for the squats. I started out with what I thought was a nice mild beginning with just 2 sets of 10 to practice form and what not but damned if it didn't turn my legs into a jelly mess the next day.

Recently started visiting weight management doctor who said I was a perfect candidate for bariatric which was enough to make me realize I had to fix some shit because there&amp;#39;s no way I&amp;#39;m doing that. So here we are about 3 months into post health focus and my 1st week of trying to get into fitness. Started at 310 and lost most of my weight early on and the coasting at 290ish inspired me to add another aspect into my routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m cheap, a shit in, hate clutter, and have very little room so my beginning focus will be body weight exercises, resistance bands, and a little under desk pedal station. All is going smoothly except for the squats. I started out with what I thought was a nice mild beginning with just 2 sets of 10 to practice form and what not but damned if it didn&amp;#39;t turn my legs into a jelly mess the next day.

I started my fitness journey in November 2022 after separation/divorce. Started around 240lb and am now a much learner and stronger 180lb.

I started doing a 2x weekly full body resistance training circuit on isometric machines, as well as cardio on workout days, daily yoga, and light daily calisthenics (pushups, planks).

My routine has shifted over time. Currently I do 2x weekly resistance on a full body circuit, yoga 2-6x a week (mostly at home, but occasional group classes) and do cardio (mostly cycling) 1-2x a week. I tried running about a month ago but the impact was too much for my joints. I'm hoping to try it again when I'm a bit learner.

I was down to 180lb in August 2023 and kept a similar routine and 'dirty bulked' up to 195 through the holidays. I've been on a cut (or maybe a recomp, my lifts have been going up and I'm feeling stronger) since January 2024 using Macro Factor. I prioritize protein and shoot for at least 120g daily. I've been taking a staged cutting approach, alternating between a deficit for a month or so followed by a few weeks at maintenance.

My current goal is to hit 170lb then re-assess. I went to lower my body fat % further then maybe start lean bulk.

,fitness30plus,"Hopefully this is the right place to ask since I’m not 25 anymore.

38M, 6’5, 245lbs

I weightlift 6x week (PPLPPL) but I’ve recently (past 4 months) really taken to cardio and increased my running to 4-5x week. About 4 weeks ago I reached the 15-mile mark, and I have stagnated in both fronts.

I’m an intermediate lifter: 365lb bench, 455 squat, 515 deadlift. I’ve been lifting for years but really started pushing weight last year after getting artificial disc replacement in my neck (c5-c7). Regaining feeling in my left arm/pec was life changing!

I’m a novice runner: 7:15 mile, 25:40 5k, 56:12 10k. My VO2max seems to be somewhere around 40-44.

Problem: If I try pushing running more, my lifting pays the price and I miss a ton of my weights; however, I do lots of tempo/sprint/recovery training each week and I do 10x100 sprints, but I’m not seeing any real improvements in my runs. I stretch and drink plenty of water but my calves still burn, ankles stay sore, and at around 8:30 pace my lungs start burning about a mile in. It’s been this way for 4 weeks now.

I don’t track calories, I was hovering around 18%bf prior to increasing my running so I started eating an extra PB&amp;J for lunch but it hasn’t helped much.

I just feel incredibly fatigued and my deload weeks don’t seem to help much.

Am I not eating enough? Do I have reasonable expectations? Is 4 months still too soon for big results?

,fitness30plus,"In 2016 I reached my all time heaviest weight at 235 pounds. As someone who is 5’4”, that is a lot of weight to carry around. I decided not soon after this picture to turn my life around. At first I made some dramatic diet decisions - going on crash diets (keto, medifast/optivia, south beach) and not exercising at all. I managed to lose quite a bit of weight (40 pounds) but I did not learn anything about maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle. When I went off of these diets I binged, hard. I managed to gain back 30 pounds and struggled to from 2018 - 2020 to lose any weight. In early 2020 I became a yoga instructor and moved every single day! I learned about the benefits of mobility and balanced eating habits. 

On December 2022 I saw a picture of myself at a NYE party and realized that despite a daily yoga practice my eating habits were back to garbage and I was much larger than I thought I was (body dismorphia is wild). I began going to the gym 4 days a week and working out for at least an hour. Very minimal improvements were seen and my energy levels were still low. In May 2023 I got a trainer who made a workout and diet plan for me and I trained for 6 months. In that 6 month time, I recomped through eating a high protein, low carb, low fat diet (1,600 calories, 100g carbs, 50g fat, 180g of protein) and lost 30 pounds while gaining muscle. 

As of the end of May, I have 60 pounds, I am stronger than I have ever been, and I feel young, sexy, and confident. I am so proud of my journey and I look forward to my next goals. 

By the end of the year I would like the complete my 3 goals below:

1. Goal weight 155 pounds

As someone who is 5’4”, that is a lot of weight to carry around. I decided not soon after this picture to turn my life around. At first I made some dramatic diet decisions - going on crash diets (keto, medifast/optivia, south beach) and not exercising at all. I managed to lose quite a bit of weight (40 pounds) but I did not learn anything about maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle. When I went off of these diets I binged, hard. I managed to gain back 30 pounds and struggled to from 2018 - 2020 to lose any weight. In early 2020 I became a yoga instructor and moved every single day! I learned about the benefits of mobility and balanced eating habits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 2022 I saw a picture of myself at a NYE party and realized that despite a daily yoga practice my eating habits were back to garbage and I was much larger than I thought I was (body dismorphia is wild). I began going to the gym 4 days a week and working out for at least an hour. Very minimal improvements were seen and my energy levels were still low. In May 2023 I got a trainer who made a workout and diet plan for me and I trained for 6 months. In that 6 month time, I recomped through eating a high protein, low carb, low fat diet (1,600 calories, 100g carbs, 50g fat, 180g of protein) and lost 30 pounds while gaining muscle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of the end of May, I have 60 pounds, I am stronger than I have ever been, and I feel young, sexy, and confident. I am so proud of my journey and I look forward to my next goals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the year I would like the complete my 3 goals below:&lt;/p&gt;

,fitness30plus,"This post is for folks who like Indian cuisine with the creamy curries,  but are on CICO. 

We are an Indian family, and although we do not eat “restaurant Indian” food regularly, we do like indulging in “butter xxxx” or “tikka masala xxxx” sometimes. I quickly realized that these are typically done with a lot of dairy fat (cream or butter) and I wouldn’t be able to keep my calories and macros in check, given how much of the fat is really needed to make these curries work. H

So if you want to make that kind of food at home - here’s another way to do it. 

*This does require you to have a good blender. We have vitamix but I’m sure other blenders should do this as well*

Dice onions and tomatoes and saute in a little oil. Take the blandest vegetable you can find (we go with squash usually) and add it to the mix. Add ginger and garlic if you like. Add a little water and spices and let it cook for 5 minutes (until onions turn translucent). 

Let this mix cool. Now take it to the blender and add *very few* cashews. Like 5-6 cashews for a serving for 3 people. 

Blend everything for a *really* long time. Blend it until it becomes like a squash soup kind of a thing. Add water if needed to “move” the mix in the blender, but keep it to a minimum. Once it’s done, ideally you would not want to feel any grit when you rub a little of this soup between your fingers. This is key as any grit will “give away” that it’s not made with cream/butter. The squash helps keeps it super thick and creamy without adding any flavor. So do the cashews but they add a little of the good flavor. 

For reference, the spices can be fresh or you can pick up a small box from a South Indian grocery store. 

Once the curry is ready, put it back on the stove. Add whatever protein you want (cottage cheese cubes, chicken, grilled chicken) and cook till done. Cook without cover as that allows the curry to thicken up even more.

We go medium on the spices - not the spices that add heat but more like cardamom, star anise, curry leaves etc. with the flavor, you’ll be hard pressed to realize that you are not eating a restaurant curry. It sticks wonderfully to the protein, has the appearance of a restaurant style curry and tastes like that without a lot of calories and fat. 

Oh, and use turmeric powder for color. Ideally the mix of turmeric, the tomatoes (and Kashmiri mirch if you prefer) should give it the the color that you are used to seeing.

,fitness30plus,"Started a weight loss and health journey last year after changing to a less stressful job. Have lost about 30lbs and did a DEXA scan this week, says I'm at 13.6% body fat in this pic for reference. Have learned so much about nutrition and health in the last year, I think I've made habits that will be sustainable as well. I was very into fitness in my youth but lost my way about 10-15 years ago and just now getting back into it. Thanks to everyone in this sub for keeping me motivated and the great advice!!! Y'all are amazing!

**Weight Tracking**

I tracked my weight nearly daily, so maybe this chart is interesting for some. A few thoughts from my end:

* It's wild how much variation in your weight can happen during the week. Almost all the spikes in the chart are either weekends or vacations. I saw 6-7 pounds of variation some weeks! It can be really hard to see w/w progress when you blow your calorie goals over the weekend. Water bloat and intestinal waste accumulation are real haha.
* Giving up alcohol is really the only time I saw strong progress in weight loss. Can see in July 2023 through August 2023, I stopped drinking and when I started back up in September you see material slow down. Did Dry January but it wasn't really enough time to see results. Have been sober for the last 5-6 weeks and I think that's why you see big progress on weight here.
* I started taking creatine in March of this year. I think I was actually losing fat during the several months after I started but the creatine water gain masked the body fat loss? Of course this is all speculation. No idea if creatine is actually doing anything or not.

**Nutrition**

I shoot for 500 calorie deficit daily. I figure out my BMR then add 20% to gauge TDE. I don't subtract anything for working out. Calorie counting is absolutely key. Macros, working out, sleep, alcohol avoidance, and water intake are secondary.

For macro's, I shoot for at least 1g/lb of body weight, 40-50g of fat, and fill the rest with carbs.

Here is my typical meal routine:

Breakfast - 2 eggs &amp; 100g of egg whites scrambled. Top generously with salsa.

Lunch - I meal prep frozen burritos every 2 weeks. Aldi Carb Counter tortillas, Greek yogurt base, sliced grape tomatoes, diced up grilled chicken. Add seasoning of your choice.

Dinner - Some kind of healthier meat (turkey, fish, chicken breast, shrimp, &gt;=90/10 beef), high volume serving of a vegetable dish (salad, grilled, sauteed, etc.), and then I typically default to potatoes of some kind (usually make my own air fry french fries). Sometimes I do a small portion of rice or pasta.

Desert - Outshine Lime/Lemon/Tangerine Fruit Pop, these bad boys are only 35 calories.

Snacks - homemade air pop popcorn, sauerkraut, pickles, kimchee, cottage cheese, berries, cucumber, carrot, apple, Archer meat stick.

**Physical Activity**

I try do low intensity walk or bike every day for 20-30 minutes. Once a week I play pick up soccer for 1-2 hours.

I do a Chest/Back, Legs, Arms/Shoulders split usually 3 days on 1 day off. Do abs almost every time I work out, typically 3 sets of 10-15 on a progressive overloadable exercise (eg machine crunch, cable crunch, hanging leg raises).

 Thanks again to everyone for your support on my journey!

To be most effective, should I:

,fitness30plus,"I see most people here are mostly into bodybuilding or powerlifting and not so much into endurance stuff. I used to run a lot in my teenage years but left that to focus mostly on weights in my 20s. Only recently two years ago I bought a shiny new carbon road bike and fell in love with the speed, and my athletic aspirations have since molded to wanting to become both fast and strong. I'm curious to know if others share this passion as well and have found a successful routine and have reached a good level in both and what kind of training they do. I realize you cannot optimize both strength and speed at the same time since excessive muscle mass slows you down and heavy endurance training eats into recovery, but I believe there exists a balance where you can be both fast and strong at the same time.

I'm currently doing around 200 km a week on saddle and lift weights 2 times a week with a focus on big compounds dl, squat, bench, ohp and pullups. More specifically I'll do 1 interval session per week 4x8 min at rpe 7-8, 2-3 1-2 hour z2 rides and unstructured sweet spot training on commutes. For strength work I do 5x5 or 3x8-12 for the main lifts and 2-3 sets for smaller muscles like arms, abs, calves and so on.

I used to run a lot in my teenage years but left that to focus mostly on weights in my 20s. Only recently two years ago I bought a shiny new carbon road bike and fell in love with the speed, and my athletic aspirations have since molded to wanting to become both fast and strong. I&amp;#39;m curious to know if others share this passion as well and have found a successful routine and have reached a good level in both and what kind of training they do. I realize you cannot optimize both strength and speed at the same time since excessive muscle mass slows you down and heavy endurance training eats into recovery, but I believe there exists a balance where you can be both fast and strong at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently doing around 200 km a week on saddle and lift weights 2 times a week with a focus on big compounds dl, squat, bench, ohp and pullups. More specifically I&amp;#39;ll do 1 interval session per week 4x8 min at rpe 7-8, 2-3 1-2 hour z2 rides and unstructured sweet spot training on commutes. For strength work I do 5x5 or 3x8-12 for the main lifts and 2-3 sets for smaller muscles like arms, abs, calves and so on.
