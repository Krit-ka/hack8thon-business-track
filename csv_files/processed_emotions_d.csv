currently working with a trainer for the last 5 months who provides nutrition guidance and weight training feedback. target calorie goal is 1800 kcal/day. average steps are 20k/day. i do a 4x/week program( 2x upper, 2x lower.) 

over the last 6 months, just haven't made much progress. still hover between 172-175. clothes fit slightly better; but don't notice much difference outside of that. i'm pretty disciplined about logging food and even taking pics. not blaming my trainer, as i think it's me. just can't seem to get past this barrier. 

don't wanna cut calories further and truthfully, short of walking around every minute of every day, going to be tough to get more steps in. just trying to get leaner and in need of some help. even considering ozempic, as much as i don't want to. just really wanna get to this weight; but it's a huge mental and physical struggle for me right now.

hey everyone, i could really use some advice. i’m trying to get back into shape, but i’m hitting a major roadblock with squats.

i haven’t been in great shape  for a while. about 10 years ago, i was doing the 5x5 routine, going to the gym regularly, and that’s the best i’ve ever looked. but now, life’s a bit different—i’ve got three young kids, and time is tight. i’ve been inspired by this sub to get fit again, and i’m trying to make the most of my home gym. i’ve got a squat rack, a box, and a bench with leg press capability.

here’s the problem: i can’t do my old go-to, the back squat, anymore. when i load the bar on my back, it feels like my shoulder and back muscles are getting pinched, and they start to spasm. plus, i can only squat about 25% of the way down before i’m stuck. i’m really struggling to figure out how to work around this. i can get all the way down with a body weight squat but i have massive lean forwards. 

my main goal right now is to lose about 20 lbs—i’m doing intermittent fasting (if) and aiming to mix weights with some hiit. but i need some tips on how to modify my routine or find alternatives to get back on track, especially with squats being out of the picture for now. any advice is welcome!",approval

0.24,1eyoygn,DamarsLastKanar,36,Why the hell am I still squatting at 41.,"it's a semi-rhetorical question that pops up a lot.  sometimes by big strong dudes far beyond my weight class.  sometimes by n00bs who fear the mere sight of the squat rack.  as this journey presses forward, i think it's important to continually meditate on the *why*.

i'll tell you one reason that isn't a factor:  quads.  specifically, size.  if having a meaty vastus medialis validates your worth as a man, woman, or enby, hey cool.  as far as *legs* go, i have other priorities.  as someone who wears cargo shorts year-round, i'd rather have meaty *calves*.  but holy hell, while i have the dad puns, i won't easily **ever** have dad calves™.  

alas.  what *could* i have?

a slightly nicer white butt.  no, i'm not dragging up dated pictures from 20 years ago when i had a scrawny white butt.  but i reckon in average bathroom lighting, [my white butt is sorta kinda okay](https://www.instagram.com/p/c9xqpn2ovbg/).

and if i take the two seconds to abuse that same lighting, pose, and apply a filter, i reckon [i have an ass worthy of instagram.](https://www.instagram.com/p/c9mraa8upv5/).  c'mon boys.  if women can moon on instagram, **so can we**.

while my gluteal hypertrophy may not qualify as big, i certainly can not lie.

*****

i was warming up today as usual, going through my [olde man warm-up](https://youtu.be/cdr4parbxua).  reflecting that, among the main six compounds, squat is probably the first i'll stop trying to progress.  i said progress - there's [value](https://youtu.be/xc0cknt4vm4) in my warm-up alone.  whatever the minimum value for health is, napsquatting one plate is above it. 

it's a warm-up.  a warm-up should be mentally easy.  it greases the groove, making work sets easier.  i hit my last warm-up set, [a single at two plates](https://youtu.be/sbbw2v-i5vs).  a mark i hit years ago grinding starting strength.  the difference now is, obviously, *there is no question about my depth*.  even if i never squat above 2 plates again, i have that parlor trick unlocked.  and to rephrase the obvious:

squatting two plates is overkill for basic minimum health.  those of you scared of the rack *seriously* never need to squat this much to see *some* benefit.

so, i load the bar with 235 lbs, as per my log.  3x3 @ 235 lbs, followed by 2x9 @ 175 lbs.  that's what i wrote down.

man, videos [make it look easier](https://youtu.be/nkf-hbz8rlu) than it felt.  two hundred thirty-five.  i'd get laughed out of any powerlifting gym.  your average bloke probably thinks i'm insane for doing it at all.  *i'm impressing nobody.* 

those that know, know:  the second downset [felt easier than the first](https://youtu.be/wa6nqv4zvy0).  i think of the guys lamenting they want their grandkids to look up to them.  kids don't care about quads, they care about piggyback rides.  a bodyweight load is more than sufficient training for piggyback rides.  except.  i don't have any progeny.  i have nothing of the sort like that to look forward to.

yup, sometimes you're rocky balboa, [sometimes you're ivan drago](https://youtu.be/qhs_ntivy4m).

it's the [stuff in the basement](https://youtu.be/d3u_u_t5cru).  i don't know what else to call it.  my 30s weren't kind to me.  i hit 30, and life decided to start chew me up and spit me out.  for long periods, i just stopped trying.  unfortunately, whether it's mind or body, *it takes a long goddamned amount of time to die*.  tried to kill myself, and unfortunately lived.  been trying to get year to year consistency since 2020.  didn't lift at all last year.

i'm stuck here.  living.  it's not so much [get busy living or get busy dying](https://youtu.be/46gwjbrmghq).  it's that *i'm stuck living*, and holy hell it takes a long time to die.  ...so might as well try living.  i don't have much of a choice.

i stared at the squat rack, as i do a lot.  as per my [favorite tattoo](https://www.instagram.com/p/c-nqz80ocxv/), i thought of captain james t. kirk.

why did kirk climb a mountain?  [because it's there](https://youtu.be/nryz5nkdtue).  that's it.  that sentiment is why i squat.  i squat *because i can*.  two good knees, bulletproof back, mobile hips.  if you want to move a couch, i'm your twunk.

later, kirk talks about how he doesn't want his pain taken away, he needs his pain.  whatever drives captain kirk, [he doesn't want it taken away](https://youtu.be/wlzjaebfeig). whatever is keeping me going, i don't need to understand it to know it's there.

whatever stuff in the basement i have, whatever in me that somehow refuses to die.  yeah, that.  that's why i squat.  maybe you know your reason, maybe you haven't understood it yet.

*""an unexamined life is not worth living."" - socrates*

i don't exactly look forward to squatting, but every time i'm done, i certainly know i'm still alive.  i squat because i'm still here.

0.57,1exq8qv,jarman65,21,I’m doing too much and I don’t know where to cut back,"i’ve (33m) always been quite active and have been consistently lifting weights since college. my routine for a number of years has been 4 days a week— push, pull, legs, and an extra upper body day with workouts lasting 45-60 mins focusing mostly on hypertrophy. i track my calories and i’m eating roughly at maintenance right now for the summer.  
  
i also use a garmin step tracker in my pocket to track my steps which seems to be more accurate/consistent compared to my apple watch which can vary widely. my garmin says i average 11-12k steps per day and my apple watch, which i wear on my dominant hand, says i average around 15k. i’m very consistent and get my steps pretty much every day unless i’m traveling. i work a desk job and most of those steps are from going for walks while listening to a podcast.  
  
i also got back into playing pickup soccer earlier this year and play once a week on a non-lifting day. before this i would do 1 or 2 3-4 miles runs a week but soccer has replaced at least one of those runs and lately both.  
  
i didn’t start playing as an adult so i’m not great and over the past month or so i’ve been doing more individual training to try to improve whether that’s practicing juggling, passing against a wall, cone drills, or passing with my wife. i generally work up a sweat since i'm chasing the ball around a bit but i'm not doing any intense sprinting. i’ve had a hard time trying to figure out how much training to do. i generally try to do some training in the morning, after work, or both if it's a non-lifting day with the aim of reaching my step goal but lately i have gotten a little carried away and been exceeding that. my garmin is reading a little higher or about the same but my apple watch is 1-4k higher.  
  
my sleep has definitely suffered and i’m waking up 1-3 hours early and having difficulty getting back to sleep or staying asleep. my sex drive has also decreased and my lifts have stalled or i've lost a rep or two because i feel so tired. at this point i just want to maintain my muscle mass/strength while getting better at soccer as fast as possible and not overdoing it. does it make sense to keep my 4 day routine, continue soccer training and just be more consistent about not exceeding my step goal or should i drop down to 3 days a week of lifting? and do you think i should be going off my apple watch or my garmin step tracker in my pocket?

fairly  limited on space currently. trying to decide if i should get something like 90lb powerblocks or a ""shorty"" olympic bar or ez bar.  also want to get an  adjustable bench (got my eye on a couple that can store upright)

concerns with getting powerblocks  is my hands are getting tired when trying to do sumo or suitcase squats with heavy olympic handles (which are kind of unwieldy, but powerblocks would at least be fast weight change)

trying to decide if ezbar would be a good progression or if a 5 or 6 ft olympic style bar would be better. 

not looking to compete or body build just age well and keep strength, lose some pudge etc. 

just trying to brainstorm here.  would consider squat stands that could be put in a corner when not actively is use. (holding off on a folding wall rack until garage cleaned out and prepped etc which is liable to be awhile)

well, 2.5 weeks ago, i started dieting fairly stringently using the lose it app. i put in a plan for having 1500-1700 calories a day, which would equate to roughly 1kg loss per week. if i worked out and made it over a specific threshold of calories expended, the app would allow for some additional caloric intake. this would happen most gym days as i would primarily do 1 hour on the stair mill burning 900-1000 calories on it. well, 2 weeks pass, and i came down to \~99kg, which i was extremely pleased with. just knowing myself, i decided to sign up for a trainer to hold myself accountable this time.

his guidance to me, has been i should be having 2200-2500 calories, and really focus on strength training rather than all the cardio i was doing. this sort of confounded me as having more calories, and building muscle seemed to be at odds with the small wins from the prior weeks. although my muscles are aching from being in recovery now, i tipped back up to 101kg this morning. i know part of this is my body trying to adjust and get everything in balance with what i'm pushing it through, but i'm curious how others here have balanced strength training, cardio, and diet. honestly, seeing the number cross 100kg was demotivating. i don't want to put my body in shock by starving it, but mentally, i really want the fat to go and the body weight to come back down. i realize losing fat while maintain/building muscle is hard to do, and will take months, so any suggestions, advice, or personal experience would be appreciated.  thanks!

i get up at 0500 daily to work out as it’s the only time i have before kiddos are awake.

at the start of this year, i weighed 115 kg and set a goal to lose 15-20 kg of body fat while also improving my cardiovascular endurance and physical strength. i’ve always been an avid lifter, but with two boys under the age of 3, there was a 2-year hiatus from lifting.

currently, i’m down about 6-7 kg, which isn’t as much as i’d hoped, but with two little ones, i’ve accepted it as a realistic outcome. for my cardio and strength goals, i wanted to run a 10k in under an hour while maintaining a deadlift of more than 2x my body weight and a squat close to 2x my body weight.

my daily calorie intake is around 2200 calories. i started my cut at 176 and had been out of the gym consistently for 2 months. my plan included having a protein shake first thing at 6:30 am, breakfast at 11:00 am, lunch at 3:00 pm, dinner at 7:00 pm, and a late-night snack at 8:00/8:30 pm.  in bed by 9:30/10:00 to ensure i was getting my 7-8 hours of sleep.

my fitness routine became waking up every morning at 5:15 am and going on a 2-4 mile walk with my dog wearing my 20lb, 5.11 tactical plate carrier vest. tried to maintain a pace of 14:30 miles while on my walks. this was done 6-7 days a week. after work, i would go to the gym in the evenings doing a bro split 5 days a week. i do track all my calories from my workouts but i use those to determine how hard i have gone in a workout vs using it as an actual count. calorie trackers like an apple watch aren't very accurate but they can help show you trends over time.

during this cut, i was able to regain all my strength from being out of the gym for a few months and start making progress in my workouts. i ended my 3-month plan with my coach down 14.2 lbs at 161.8 and the leanest i have ever been. this is the lowest weight i have been since 7th grade. post plan i have cut another 1.2 lbs and counting.

something i've been working on this year is trying to work on consistency of effort. i've had to have a bit of a hard talk with myself to figure out why some of my muscle groups have been growing really well - back, quads, arms - but others have been really disappointing - chest and shoulders especially. it's getting to the point where i'm growing a gorilla back but a dyel chest. 

i thought i had been training pretty hard and consistently, so i thought at first it was maybe just how my genetics worked. maybe it is, but i think the answer is more simple. i'm good at deadlifts and i enjoy them. i go all out on my rowing exercises. meanwhile, i suck at pressing movements and i don't enjoy them. i half-ass my lateral raises. i probably just try and get through the reps more than i actually apply my best work. 

seems likely in my case that my genetics are not the issue and my effort is simply misapplied in some cases. so i have the perception of ""yeah, i've been training hard"", but also having to admit that consistently across certain movements i've been phoning it in.  

the irony here is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. maybe instead if i attacked my pressing movements with dedication and intensity i might actually get good at them and enjoy them.

that's the epiphany i had this week, wondering if others came to a similar realisation at some point. i always knew that training hard was a necessary criteria but i didn't appreciate until now that you you have to be careful to make sure you don't just favour the things you're good at.",joy

does anyone have any ideas what might be causing this and have tips to reduce the symptoms? the sleep is extremely uncomfortable and results in me endlessly waking up, moving around, and just general anxiety and discomfort for whatever reason.

i've done lots of strenght training and a lot of biking for many many years, but i had life events that put me deep into a hole. so i'm no stranger to the barbell exercises, or exercises in general.

it’s been maybe half a year since i trained last time and today i started again, and lifted a heavy, but not crazy heavy, weight for me, but it was so though!

that’s when i remembered that the last time i did deadlifts, i dropped the barbell around halfway down.

i’m 40+ and i feel like it is highly unecessary stress for those last 20-25 cm, especially at weights starting at my body weight or higher. also that’s not what you see in contests either. though i am just a middle aged out of shape dad.

40+ people who deadlift - do you drop the weight or put it down nicely?

**edit:** i should have clarified 45 comments ago, that i do not just let go. i have my hands on the bar, i am in control, but i dont offer it much resistance on the way down. my concentric movement i do as fast as i can still being in control, and the eccentric movement i dont offer much resistance.

the questions about the workout and additional stuff to do.

(1) on the rest day, i would like to do some additional cardio ( eclyptical cross trainer and cycle ergometer). shouldn’t interfere with the routine; right?

(2) i also want to improve posture and flexibility.  i had a couple of ideas of tackling this:
daily, i do wall angels (also called slides)and this routine https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=ftv6uch-yhs  each morning and evening
on the rest day, i thought of adding this workout: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=4botvaradji 
i supplement the leg days with some abs exercises like dead bugs and rkc planks,  the push days with shoulder dislocations (rotating shoulders with broomsticks/bands), and the pull days with low resistance face pulls. makes sense?

(3) any other flexibility, stretching or posture advice you can give? i was also thinking of giving https://www.reddit.com/r/flexibility/wiki/starting_to_stretch a go

(4) i like bodyweight exercises and will do push ups, pull ups, chin ups and so on. i rarely see planches mentioned but they seem like a push exercise. weekly i though of doing one push day with push ups and one with planches. makes sense?",neutral
0.96,1epjauq,strengthtoovercome,20,Functional fitness exercise database in Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets for strength training (version 1.9 update),"hey r/fitness30plus community, 

i created a functional fitness exercise database in microsoft excel and google sheets for strength training – it’s a free resource to help keep all of your strength training exercises organized and quickly accessed in an easy-to-use spreadsheet for your workouts (https://www.reddit.com/r/personaltraining/s/cvi4juymcv). i am constantly updating the exercise database each month with new equipment, exercises, and search filters - so i wanted to share a quick summary of the additions to the database for august. 

the highlight of this update is adding the tire as a primary equipment item, 43 new calf raise variations (standing, seated, split squat isometric) and adding “shins” to “target muscle group” and its associated tibialis raise exercises. a full breakdown of all of the updates in version 1.9 is listed below, as well as the download link to get your updated copy of the database.

more about the exercise database:

it is time consuming to sift through all the exercise information available on the internet (multiple exercise databases, youtube videos, fitness pages/social media), so i made this to have all of the data in one spreadsheet that can be quickly filtered for your exercise search. the database has more than 25 search filters available for over 2000 + functional exercises - allowing you to find the information you need in seconds when designing fitness programs or learning new movement patterns. 

the fitness library also includes exercises using the barbell, dumbbells, kettlebells, gymnastics rings, parallette bars, calisthenics, clubbells, indian clubs, maces, the bulgarian bag, the heavy sandbag, the tire, the landmine attachment, suspension trainer, sliders and other functional equipment that you may not have used for your current workouts. all exercises requiring you to move, stabilize, and develop functional and pain free strength.

in this version 1.9 update, i have added the following to the exercise database:

-	added “tire” as a new “primary equipment” item.
-	added “shins” as a new “target muscle group” item.
-	added 43 new calf raise variations (standing, seated, split squat isometric) to target soleus or gastrocnemius.
-	added 39 new slider reverse lunge variations.
-	added 24 new bodyweight exercises.
-	added 22 new tire exercises.
-	added 21 new kettlebell exercises.
-	added 18 new dumbbell exercises.
-	added 15 new clubbell exercises.
-	added 14 new ez bar exercises.
-	added 12 new dumbbell bicep curl variations.
-	added 10 new skull crusher variations.
-	added 9 new barbell olympic weightlifting exercises.
-	added 6 new carry variations.
-	added 5 new tibialis raise variations.
-	added 3 new macebell exercises.
-	added 15 additional new miscellaneous exercises.
-	added 11 missing video demonstrations for kettlebell lunge variations
-	added 3 missing video demonstrations for the heavy sandbag
-	added “none” for blank entries under “secondary equipment”
-	added missing “bench” items under “secondary equipment” for seated exercises and hip thrust variations
-	changed exercise name “box step up to single leg balance” to “box russian step up”
-	changed “half knee hover” posture to “split squat isometric”. seems to be a more standardized description for the position.
-	changed “adductor slide” to “slider lateral lunge” for consistency with rest of database.
-	switched a number of “video demonstration” videos that are better suited as “video explanation” videos. going to keep video demonstrations as non-verbal and just a quick snapshot of the movement pattern. 
-	replaced various broken “video demonstration” links. 
-	corrected “skater squat” variations posture to “single leg standing”.

i was 160kg 10 years ago. i lost 50 kg in a span of 2 years following a low fat diet and going to the gym doing weight lifting. fast forward 10 years. i am still weight training. however i gained some of that weight back. i am a lot more muscular than before though.

i currently go to gym 2,3 times a week and do mostly compound movements (5x5 and ss stuff) and some light cardio. sadly i'm currently very sedentary due to having a newborn.

my focus is to lose the weight and lower the fat %, have a good amount of muscle and improve my conditioning. 

my question is: is there some sport or type of training that i could do, that is inline with my targets, and that being on a high fat percentage is an advantage? if not, what would you suggest me to do? 

edit: what about martial arts? boxing?

here's the part that i don't understand.  i haven't trained deadlifts or even done rdl's in probably two months.  i've been doing my own upper lower split lately, and for legs, i've been squatting, doing leg extensions and leg curls on a janky weight bench attachment i got for free, and doing calf raises.  the last time i deadlifted prior, i did 295 and i couldn't get 315 up past a few inches from the ground.  just wasn't happening.  last night, i did 135 x 5, 225 x 3, 275 x 1, and then 295 x 1.  the 295 was fairly easy, so i figured what the heck.  315 went up pretty quickly and easily.  the only thing that seemed like it might fail was my grip.

so i wonder what's up with that?  did the leg curls help?  was it all in my head?  did taking a break from the deadlift....help my deadlift?  maybe i was overtraining earlier?  i wouldn't think i was overtraining (was loosely following starting strength programming for squat and dl only there for a while), but i will be 50 in september so...maybe i can't handle a ton of volume.  so, yeah, i still don't understand weight training.  stop doing something for a couple of months to get better at it?  maybe i should lay off squatting for a while too....haha.",neutral

i need to get some direction to help my parents (mom 56, dad 63) ease into strength training.

(general rant/discussion thread)","now i know in principle it's exactly the same game. you just need to eat less than you burn. you adjust what you eat if the needle isn't moving. maybe you move around more. same principle. simple in theory. 

but man, the actual *execution* of it definitely takes way more deliberate and focused attention now. what was i doing when i was 21? working in a car wash for 8 hours a day in the sun. skipping meals because i was broke. going entire days on a single burrito.  drinking corona and getting drunk off 4 of them.  any extra lbs probably just helped me look better. 

what does life look like now? let's use step counting as a proxy. i drive to and from work, i sit in an office chair all day.  if i don't go out of my way to do some cardio then in i'll probably walk less than 2000 steps a day. lifting weights hardly changes things at all, that step counter gets up to maybe 4000 on a regular gym day. getting my total activity up to a more reasonable weekly level means deliberately saying ""no"" to various other things i want to do, every day. that's an hour walking when i could be doing countless other things. 

and then food. i have money to buy food whenever i want now.  even if i don't snack and i just have two ""regular"" meals a day (regular meaning: portions i'm used to), i'm coasting by at maintenance weight. my taste for beer only grew in richness and volume. it's not 4 light beers if i want to get drunk now, it's a 3 pints of wheat bear and a bottle of wine. every goddamn day in the office it's someone's birthday and there's cake. and now because i lift i have to make sure i still get a lot of protein in while keeping calories low. when i was 21 i didn't care about cooking. now my soul cries if i'm not pouring olive oil on things. 

all this to say, it's a little frustrating trying to lose weight and knowing in principle what you're supposed to do, but facing the reality of 1) no snacks, 2) two smaller meals, 3) cutting most alcohol, 4) doing a bunch of low intensity cardio activity you know in your heart of hearts is not even in the top 5 things you would rather do.

i just had my body composition scan and it showed i have lost about 5% of fat while putting on about 6lbs of muscle over the past year. all things considered (mainly that i only workout an hour a week) i think the progress isn't bad and yet i still feel like i haven't made much progress at all. i do have a harder time with being consistent with my diet than i do working out so i know that's a factor.

*tldr*
my trainer says he would like to get my rmr up to the 1500 range and he thinks that'll have more impact with my weight loss/fat loss. it's currently in the high 1300 range. it's gone up by about 70 over the last year. seems like a silly question but is it really possible to increase your rmr by that much? and does my current rmr seem low. everything i've googled kinda looks like it's lower than average.

edit: i know rmr is the number of calories you burn at rest, basically doing nothing. so basically my trainer wants to build my body to where it's able to burn more calories from just existing. probably because i have times when i'm not as consistent with what i'm eating and tracking. i currently try to eat around 1500 to 1700 calories which puts me in a deficit of about 500 to 700 from how much i was eating when i put on weight. but i've definitely had moments where i was probably eating at maintenance when i stopped tracking. i'm pretty sure his thinking is that if my rmr is high i won't have to be as strict with tracking so when i have moments of falling off it won't be detrimental.",neutral

good/weird: my visceral fat actually dropped substantially from 0.93 lbs &gt; 0.67 lbs

bad/weird: it says i lost 1.3 lbs in my trunk (don't see how that makes sense given my lifts are all up), but gained in my legs and arms

unfortunately i store a lot of fat in my trunk and android areas at 19.2% and 19.1%

the lifts i seriously track for reference:

bench: 225 x 7 &gt; 225 x 10

squat: 275 x 5 &gt; 290 x 7

my goal is to put on lean tissue so that my eventual cut to 13-14% (i have trouble realistically dropping below this) is at a higher weight. the bottom of my last cut was 189ish and i would like to hold more muscle at that body fat than i had then.",neutral

i think over 30 you can still make good gains, you just need to dial in your diet and sleep. you're no longer partying like you're in your 20s so in theory it should be easier. another big thing is exercise selection- choose movements/exercises that agree with your joints. you're not glass, but you aren't as indestructible/heal as quickly as someone in their teens/20s and (avoidable) downtime is going to kill your progress.

behind the neck press 60-&gt;72 (160)  
  
program overview  
juggernaut 2.0 is designed to be for developing all round athleticism. its not a powerlifting program and the focus is on sub maximal training becausr the only irreplaceable part of a training program is the sport itself.  theres only one set in the 16 week program for each lift at 90%.  
the lifts are run in 4 week cycles focusing on 10 reps, 8 reps, 5 reps and 3 reps with a deload every 4th week.  
i did the ""what i do"" for the accessories (pullups, dips, ab wheel, good mornings, hamstrings, lunges, squats) and used simplified conditioning (30s '@ 70% watts rowing, 8 press ups, 10 sit ups, 15s rest)  
  
my background  
i'd previously been running a powerbuilding program that i added cardio to. this meant i was doing 6 weight sessions a week 40 minutes-1 hour and 5 cardio session of 30 minutes. and with getting changed, grabbing a coffee and prep this was taking 10 hours a week. i've got a young son so that sort of routine was no longer viable.  
  
i do judo mainly so strength and conditioning isnt going to be my priority, i also have a 15 month old, so i was missing sessions and cutting assistance / cardio short all over the place, saying id do abs later and forgetting about stretching.  
  
what i liked  
doing abs first as a warm up meant i was no longer skipping them, as long as i dont half ass the workout i'm able to finish in an hour, including taking 5 minutes at the end to stretch.  
adding sprinting in really helped with things like playing 5 a side football on a stag do and general athelicism.  
i've not tested my jumps really, but doing weighted jumps hopefully will lead to being about to dunk a basketball, not really a major objective.  
the plate halos uncovered a weakness in my neck/ upper back that i resolved by doing really light weights nice and slowly.  
emphasis on pullups and dips kept my general athleticism for murph without needing specific prep.   
four days a week gives a lot of flexibility for when life gets in the way, even if you have to go away with work for a couple of days you can move the workouts around.  
deload weeks mean you're not building up too much soreness and they always seemed to come at a time i could do with being in the gym for less time, which was lucky.  
sub maximal training meant i wasnt destroying myself before a judo session, and especially on the deload weeks i could perform really highly in training (sport training has too many variables based on lesson plan, who shows up to plan intensity so having a lot left in the tank is useful)  
switching out exercises gave a lot of variety, i switched to front squats to reduce the load on my lower back as judo tends to do a lot of that for posture and behind the neck press rather than militsry because ive liked the shoulder gains i got from that.  
  
what im confused about  
doing sprints before lower body seems to reduce my maximum sets, not sure if i should swtich it round for realisation week, if im wrong about the order or if because its not specifically powerlifting focused the sprinting should take priority for great athleticism.   
i added some warm up sets on the exercise i was doing which i don't remember from the ebook. i also found i wasn't really ready for the 3+ realisation set and needed to do more doubles. it might mean the rest of my warm up is too light.   
  
conclusion  
im only realising now that the point of keeping the increments small is that you can drop your reps on the amrap and continue hitting greater estimated 1rm, so if you managed a 80x16 last 10s wave time, and have a bad day after youve increased to 90 for your working weight, you can still go north of 10 reps, rather than constantly hitting to minimum required reps and having no where else to progress.  
im spending less time, getting more done and am back to or past my previous lifetime 1rm. not sure theres really a downside to this for me.  
i didnt follow the schedule for peaking at the end of the 16 week program so really couldnt have expected my 1rm to be as high as calculated.  
  
whats next  
i'm going to run another cycle to see if this progress is sustainable or if it was just a combination of starting very light and regaining previously lost strength. the weights section of program seems to be heavily inspired by 5/3/1 so it might be worth my looking into that after this cycle to see if i can get more touches at 90% and above because me lower rep work was rubbish!   
  
tl;dr: started spending less time in the gym and fewer sets; got my sets back to or past previous lifetime 1rm without needing to gain weight. highly recommend this program.",neutral

but i feel like there's more between high intensity and low intensity. i wanna try to see if there's more i can get out of the limited energy production my body now has. i gained weight, i gained cellulite, i'm 35 years old and wanna feel more fit in my body. motivation is another issue: i find no joy in jogging or fitness machine stuff at the gym. does anyone wanna think with me about some good options?

i like sports that also sharpen your skills, so i was thinking about bouldering (sideways mountain climbing). do you have more suggestions for me? my plan is to do a bunch of tryout lessons to find my new, middle intensity, sport.",neutral

1.0,1ei1aio,roflmctofl,6,Confused about whether to reverse diet or cut,"hi all, initially i started with wanting to go on a cut. i lift weights (heavy) 3-4x a week, hitting on avg 100g of protein daily, and get more than 10k steps daily over the past month. prior to this i was already lifting for the past 2 years, but with no structured program or nutrition tracking. after tracking my calories for the last month with mfp and nsunns tracker, i've come to learn that my tdee is between 1,500 - 1,600 cals, and i have most likely been eating at maintenance. the lean muscle gains have been minimal (or maybe i think this because my bf % is on the higher end) but strength has been significant. i tried to do a cut at 1,400 cals and was losing 0.2kg a week, but have found this difficult to sustain.

anyway, this is where i'm 'stuck', as i've seen the positive effects of reverse diet on this sub and also read / watched videos about it on youtube. it makes so much sense to slowly start eating more calories to help build lean muscle so that i reach a point where cutting becomes sustainable. my dilemma stems from the fact that my body fat % is still on the higher end (30%) - which was why i initially thought i should cut.

my cw is 59kg, height is 5'1 (am a 32yo female).

any advice would be super helpful here! also need recommendations on workout plans for progressive overloading / building lean muscle for women. thanks in advance!",neutral

as a single day i have limited time. my daughter is 5 and takes most of my time. i am lucky if i can get an hour to myself each day, so gym trips are unlikely at this point.

believe it or not i eat reasonably well. fruit, oats and some almonds for breakfast. spinach, salmon and chicken for lunch. and for dinner usually chicken breast, carrots, sweet potato. during the day i while snack on apples and almonds. i have not eaten junk food for three decades and no juice or alcohol.

activity wise i do basic sit-ups, push-ups and light weights for 30 minutes each day and approximately 20 minutes intentional walking. lots of running around after my daughter.

so - approximately half way through a pretty significant weight cut  (down approximately 50 lbs, 388 to 338 in 4.5 months - 40 years old - 6 ft 1, always the ‘big guy’ not so much the ‘fat guy’ )
most of it through clean eating/calorie tracking (lose it! app) with weight lifting,  approx. 3-4 times per week.
i get most of my cardio requirements through work (first responder - i can hustle for a big boy ! lol ) 
anyways - my training is changing more to lifting heavier, and focusing on some muscle development as i continue to cut weight (goal is ultimately 280 lbs) and my very very fit co-worker recommended that i start taking creatine 15-25 mg per day - with some good scientific sources to back up the recommendation. he believes that this dose wouldn’t lead to much if any water retention issues/weight gain.
he’s also in his mid 20s and incredibly fit - lol

i suppose my question is:
at my age, do ya’ll believe that introducing creatine during a weight cut is a smart thing to do ? or maybe wait until i’m closer to that ultimate weight goal and introduce it then ? 
i’m mainly apprehensive as i’ve been averaging approximately 11 lbs lost per month, and have been pretty happy with how this process has come - and am nervous to make any changes to something that’s clearly working quite well.
just looking for some opinions i suppose.

in 5 weeks, i went from 204lbs down to 190lbs, losing weight reliably every week. however, for the past 3 weeks i have stayed at 190lbs.

i meticulously count calories every single day, i never eat more than what i log in myfitnesspal. i average 1550 calories per day.
i weigh myself the same day, every week, and at the same time, with the same clothes. i have upheld my diet and deficit average of 1550 by eating essentially the same foods per week.

i specifically only eat food that’s easy for me to track and doesn't require eyeballing. i don't cook with added oils, or use any sauces or dressings. i only drink water, or a cup of apple juice at dinner if calories allow. if something isn't labeled, i use a scale to measure the weight and look up usda nutrition estimates, as well as check myfitnesspal for entries. if something is listed but varies wildly in calorie count, i always choose the highest calorie count listed and adjust my day.

i lift weights 4 times a week and do progressive overload, seeing regular strength gains overtime. otherwise, i live a sedentary life.

i started dieting and exercising in may out of the blue, so it is brand new but i haven't ""cheated"" my diet once. i don't do cheat meals or cheat days, and i don't skip any exercise days, and i don't binge eat.

i am afraid to cut calories further if this is actually just water weight, and potentially hurt myself from not eating enough. the problem is that i have no idea if this is water weight or not, and i'm not sure what guaranteed method is there to check.

this is my first post and i'm posting because i'm kind of lost. ive always been quite active, did ballet as a kid and played basketball at uni.

two years ago i started having panic attacks and relapsed back into depression. i became sedentary and started eating lots of junk food. depression sucks. now i want to get healthier and start exercising again on a regular basis. 

it feels kind of weird though. thing is: i've had an eating disorder for a very long time (anorexia and bulimia), so starting this 'fitness journey' is scary. i'm scared it will trigger old habits and that i'll relapse. however, i do have to get healthier. my clothes don't fit properly anymore and i feel unhealthy. 

creating a routine feels difficult: i want to be strict, but not too strict. i want to push myself, but not to an unhealthy extent. i've now created this routine for myself:

monday: strength training
tuesday: rest day, bit of yoga or walking
wednesday: strength training
thursday: running
friday: rest day, yoga/running
saturday: strength training 
sunday: spinning class

am starting at the most basic level, strength training is simply five compound exercises,  starting with a 15 kg barbell or 4 kg dumbbells. i intend to increase that weight when i'm able to lift 4x 8 reps with two extra reps effortlessly (i believe this technique has a name, but i forgot sorry!) 

running is also very basic, starting with 4x 2 minutes running. i intend to increase that every month or so. 

i really wanted to check with you whether my routine is okay. there's just so much information on the internet.  😟 it's making me insecure. 

i know it's all about balance, but i also really want to see results without relapsing into an ed. am i asking too much of myself?

i deload as recommended by all programs.. i do a bit of physical therapy and i have a lifting coach i see occasionally just to help me dial in my technique on compound lifts.

sbs has been great. i'm hitting prs every session.. my lifts have gone up significantly - i've gained about 5kg of good weight - for the most part i'm feeling really good.

example structure: 2 main lifts (sq+db ohp) - 1 back movement (weighted pull ups etc) - 2 accessories (generally bodybuilding/gym bro stuff)

however. in the past 3 weeks or so i've hit a bit of a wall. not on the books (linear progression, still progressing) .. but just in my head and in my energy levels... my big lifts are getting heavy... or at least heavy for me.. i'm finding that once i've completed them and the back exercise - i'm just gassed... i just took a full week off only to return to the same issue.. i've just been dropping the accessory stuff. i'm fine with that although it does kind of bug me that i'm not completing the full workout.

but the fatigue is pretty noticeable - i'm not really enjoying my time in the gym as much it's feeling like a chore i'm just dragging myself in there... hitting the numbers and leaving.

i mean ... as i said ... my squat, dead, bench and ohp are all heavier than they've ever been. i'm happy with the progress there.



anyone have any experience or advice here? i'm sort of wondering if maybe once i finish this program whether to pivot to something different... higher reps/lighter weights ... less compound stuff for a while or what... how best to manage the fatigue moving forward.

in may of 2020 i stopped drinking and dropped about 27 lbs., but never budged much further. in june 2023 i started seeing an endocrinologist for my pcos. he got me on medications for my insulin resistance and elevated androgens. that day i calculated my tdee, got back on myfitnesspal for the 100th time, started counting calories and doing minimal exercises at home. mostly, i just chased around my kids. i started throwing in squats while waiting for water to boil, jumping jacks while waiting for the shower to heat up, leg lifts and crunches, girly push ups while playing with the kids on the floor. sometimes i'd use the stationary bike. just sporadic things.

anyways... i kept going this time. by november, i was down to the 130s. i saw my endo and asked if he thought i'd be a good candidate for skin removal surgery. he agreed that i would be and referred me to the head of plastics and reconstruction at the u of m. i had my consultation with him in february. he took photos of me and went over my medical history. then he submitted my information to my insurance, bcbs, and we waited. mid-april i heard back that my insurance found the operation to be medically necessary. may 10th, 1 day before my 39th birthday, i had my excess abdominal skin removed.

Creates such a mental load and burden  ,"we’ve been working out together for a few months. he’ll put me through a whole body strength training with some cardio and abs session. at the end he’ll have me walk over to the pull up bar with a thin orange resistance band or two and have me attempt these pull ups. even with the bands i struggle and can barely get a single rep in. he usually has to push my back up to get me to reach. this burdens me with such guilt and frustration. i’ll be giving it my all and yet i’m not strong enough. i tell him i can’t do it and i need to get more upper body strength first but he’s adamant and tells me i need to overcome it. i think he just doesn’t fully know how incapable i am of doing it or the amount of muscles i still lack for it.
i bought my own pull up bar for the house and would love to get there but i’m just at a loss still. any advice?

0.7,1e6kull,Suspicious-Ad-9380,7,Muscle gain from walking?,"i (m37, 280lb) spent 3 months slowly ramping up my gym time. i alternated weight and cardio days. i lost net 7 pounds. my cardio is inclined walks (15% grade, 2-3mph for 35-65 min). i saw some muscle growth during that time in my arms and legs. 

i also cleaned up my diet during that time. in an effort to increase weight loss i switched to two cardio workouts for every lifting workout for the past month and my weight loss has plateaued. i still feel sore the next day from the cardio.

i've been doing cable crunches for about 4 months and for at least a couple months they have been hurting my lower back/spine. sometimes it's just a little sore for a day or two, sometimes there is acute pain when i'm doing them and a couple weeks ago i had to stop doing them because my lower back hurt too much the next day.

i don't have a video of my form but i did link a video that i think shows a similar form to mine - except i use a bar. many people do this exercise slightly different so i wanted to show ""my"" form. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbtidlz0y7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbtidlz0y7s) (@1:25)

some ideas i've had to fix this:

* strengthen my lower back
* change my form up in some way
* replace it with another exercise

i really don't want to give up on this exercise since i feel a strong mind muscle connection with it and it's easy to progressively overload.

i would love to hear from people for fixed a similar problem, but all advice is welcomed!

0.92,1e5xoue,Strict-Witness3003,17,Any women with low testosterone have any success stories?,"i’m 32/f. long story short, i have always been extremely athletic until about two years ago. i could sling around heavy weight for my size, was in insane cardio shape. slowly after i turned 29 i started to notice my energy levels disintegrating, ultimately making the gym a source of my debilitating exhaustion (working out would literally leave me bed bound for 2-3 days).

every day i wake up i am exhausted. and it’s not like i’m just sleepy, it’s that all of my variables are perfect yet i cannot function through the intense fatigue. fwiw, i’m on a pretty strict mediterranean diet protocol and supplementation protocol with a functional doctor and nutritionist. i’ve had a lot of work-ups done over the year, everything from lupus to epstein-barr to vitamin deficiencies, etc. etc. all normal. so they called it chronic fatigue syndrome. 

but i finally did an updated hormone panel which was flawless outside of low testosterone (i definitely thought it was perimenopause but that isn’t the case). not only fatigue has been an issue, but i’ve pretty much had a textbook description of low testosterone that just makes sense now. 

i hesitated about hrt but decided to pursue it because i am so tired of feeling this way. i started last friday and of course haven’t had effects yet. it is a very low dose obviously being female. but i’m just sitting here, wishing i could workout but walking to the kitchen even feels like a chore. i miss having energy and feeling vibrant.

started compound lifting program of barbell bench press, overhead press, deadlift with assisted pull-ups and bulgarian split squat (dumbell) 3x per week.  ate at dexa derived rmr + active calories on apple watch 500 calorie/day deficit for a lot of 2023 and had a ton of fat loss without lean mass loss.  got covid in early 2024 and fell off the wagon a bit.

been really serious about weights and diet since april: increasing weight and eating at a neutral level of calories + minimum 2 grams of protein/kg/day.

my last dexa shows a 2 pound lean mass gain per month from april to now.  this seems too fast for what i read is possible online.  i've lost 21 pounds of fat while gaining 10 pounds of muscle in the last 15 months.  i definitely feel as strong as i've ever felt and have muscle vasculature in my arms that i've never seen before.  still have some fat around my midsection - no abs - but abdominal circumference has dropped from 34"" to 30"".

is body recomposition like this really possible - at 39 years old?  is the dexa wrong?  i'd always read it was almost impossible to gain lean mass rapidly without ""bulking"" phases with fat gain, but that's what this shows.

#training protocol:

six sessions spaced out over 14 days. each session consisted of what are known as a [wingate protocol](https://theory.labster.com/wingate-sprint/) —30 seconds of all-out effort followed by 4.5 minutes of easy exercise (like walking) done 5 times in a row, back to back, so a complete single training session is 25 minutes long. in my case i used an airdynex bike in a gym that had a good amount of resistance but a bike isn't required, what matters is the all-out, total body intensity.

in 5 sessions out of 6 i did the hiit sessions after i had done my weightlifting for the day; with the sixth session, i did the wingate protocol before lifting weights. 

one thing that surprised me was the crazy pump i got in my thighs after i was done with the fifth sprint in the session, which i took advantage of by going immediately into doing some heavy squat lifts.

#caveats:

the dramatic gains i got out of 6 sessions has a lot to do with the fact that i wasn’t doing any cardiovascular training prior; i am essentially untrained. i also don’t think another 6 sessions is going to yield another 40% increase in my vo2 max number; as people get more and more trained in any area, it takes more and more effort to get progressively smaller gains due to diminishing returns and getting closer to your own genetic/biological limits means there’s less room for growth as time goes on.

#background:

i’ve been doing calisthenics / r/bodyweightfitness since early 2021 and two years in i realized i should also be doing *something* for cardio. i didn’t want to run because my feet hitting the pavement would cause shin splints so i opted for jumping rope instead but trying to go from zero to 2 minutes of jumping rope took a couple weeks since i hadn’t done it since i was a kid. after a couple months i was able to do 5 minutes of moderately paced rope-jumping but i didn’t really keep up with it at this point because i wasn’t sure how to progress—add more time to 10 minutes, 20 minutes, or try to whip the rope around and jump as fast as possible?

eventually i just stopped doing it altogether last year since i didn’t feel like i was getting much out of it for the time and energy invested.

fast forward to 1-2 months ago and i discovered martin gibala’ s book [*the one-minute workout: science shows a way to get fit that's smarter, faster, shorter*](https://www.mediafire.com/file/txw6zt9flcqg5ep/gibala%252c_martin_-_the_one-minute_workout.pdf/file) which immediately appealed to me because i knew from my strength training background that heavy loads/intensive training produces a stronger stimulus for muscle growth than doing more reps that are of only light/moderate intensity/weight. high-intensity interval training (hiit) works somewhat similarly.

when i came across the following passages in the book i knew i had to try this specific protocol for myself: 

&gt; “the six training sessions conducted by the subjects required them to sprint on a stationary bicycle. the specific protocol is known as a wingate test (named after the israeli sports institute where it was developed, the wingate institute), which is designed to measure someone’s anaerobic power—the all-out explosive effort necessary to bike, skate, run, or swim as fast as possible. you hop into the saddle and pedal as hard and as fast as you can for thirty seconds against a high resistance. the idea is to go all out. 'go as hard as you can,' i told the subjects. 'as if you’re sprinting to save a child from an oncoming car—go that fast.'”

&gt; “as the results came in, it was difficult to maintain that façade of impartiality. the numbers were crazy. the sprinters had doubled their endurance times. on average, before the training, the eight subjects could pedal the bike for 26 minutes until exhaustion. following the six sessions of interval training, the average time was 51 minutes. it was an amazing result.”

&gt; “the sprints changed the subjects’ bodies in other ways, too. we obtained biopsies of their thigh muscles before and after training. the biopsies showed that, after the training, subjects had significantly more mitochondria in their muscles—because a key enzymatic marker, citrate synthase, increased by 38%. that matters because mitochondria are the muscles’ powerhouses.”

&gt; “and keep this in mind: we used a stationary cycle for our study for pragmatic reasons, but we figured the results would be the same for any activity conducive to a sprint approach, such as running, rowing, and even stair climbing. and in the 10+ years that have passed since, this expectation has been borne out.”

so i went and did it and got great results.

another interesting thing the book mentions is that sprint intervals was how champion long-distance runners used to train because this method did such a great job increasing vo2 max in such a short time period.",neutral

i can take all the gear i want i will never look like a pro bodybuilder, same for you.

diet - 3500 - 4k calories daily - i am a type 2 diabetic so i'm careful with what i ingest, so my carbs have remained lower in recent years, which was an adjustment 

my current weight right now is 242lbs.

i've been training seriously for 26 years, most of it competing in powerlifting and strongman.

over the past 2 years i had a lifting existential crisis.  it was a big shift from training for strength and perfoming well at competitions, to training because i love it.  it took a while but i'm still chugging away and will continue to do so 

i'm a disciple of mike isratel so currently i'm using a myo rep approach towards many movements, i train 5x daily 

for me high frequency and tempered volume works well 

all movements are in the rep range of 10 - 25.
day 1 
hammerstrength incline press - myo reps 
db lateral - myo reps 
pronated chest supported row - myo reps 
pec dec - myo reps 

day 2 
belt squat - myo reps

i (f/35) am new to running - new to consistent exercise in general. june 29 i just up and did a mile (running and walking) - and have done a mile (run/walk) or 2 mile (speed walk) every day since.

when i run/walk the mile, i will run/jog until my lower leg begins to have some discomfort then slow to a speed walk. i have no issue with the thought of pushing through pain, but because i just jumped into it, i want to make sure i prevent shin splints and (potentially?) stress fractures. at this time, i can finish a mile (running and walking) in about 12 minutes, and can speed walk a mile in less than 14 minutes. i am working to decrease these numbers as safely as possible.

unfortunately, most of the outdoor surfaces i run on are concrete. i do go to the gym once or twice a week to run on a treadmill.

i am building up my water intake, i have tried different stretches before i go run/walk, and i have iced my shin a few times (albeit not consistently).

so… my question is… what is (typically) normal to feel in your legs while running?
also, are there any other tips/suggestions you can throw at me?

my main contributors to success were exactly what i lacked at the start; discipline and consistency. i ate at around 1800 calories for 5 months and bumped it up to 2000 for the last month. i never hit a plateau, but i truly stayed on diet 100% of the time. zero fried foods, low (almost zero sugar), no alcohol, and very high protein intake (200g a day). exercise consisted of daily cardio (sorry, i know people, including myself don't want to hear that) and weights 5 times a week. my sessions in the weight room averaged an hour, but occasionally pushed 90min. energy levels have been high, but buoyed but 500mg+ of caffeine a day. no creatine, but plenty of fish oil, men's daily vitamins and bcaas.

as i am getting older recovery is the hardest part. in the beginning i tried running everyday ended up with achilles tendinitis. 
i was doing 2 boxing sessions a week and 2 muay thai sessions a week. but not lifting. 


some weeks i only run once and most weeks i only go to one boxing lesson or skip boxing altogether. but i go to two muay thai classes and have started bjj at one class a week.


i missed lifting so cut running down to 1-2 times a week. i have been following geoff nupert’s easy muscle program went from 24kg bells to 32kg’s which are still a struggle. 

this is one of my all time favourite programs it’s 3 days a week. only 30 mins and includes pull ups and dips. i have ran this program over and over again and always come back to it. 

i have just completed this program with 32kg bells for the first time and want to have a deload before running something else from him or running it again. 

i am a sucker for routine and when ever i stop lifting or following a program i have a tendency to fart arse about and end up taking an extended break and self sabotage. 

so what would you recommend for a deload still lifting 3 days a week with my martial arts and cardio schedule. 

do i need a deload? should i focus more on body weight and callisthenics is one week enough before re running the same program?

in my previous post i pretty much laid out my issues and my plan to recover. however, i find myself constantly wanting to eat more or just eat garbage. i'm calorie counting now and doing well but in the back of my mind there's s little voice saying...

after my major surgery it’s left me with some complications - one i can’t lift anything heavy. two - sometimes i feel quite depressed. i have also started fostering a wonderful young boy as well, so have way less time than usual. 

by the end of the evening, i usually feel too tired to cook and order something or we have stuff quick and shit like pizza or noodles. our young lad came to us with a very restricted diet anyway so it’s hard sometimes to think i’ll cook for us and for him, so we often end up having what he’s having. 

i’m hungry all the time and i’m not sure if that’s an emotional thing, but i snack throughout the day. 

i’ve put on 2 stone since my surgery and it’s not helping me with how i’m feeling about myself. every single day i get up and think this is a new day, i’ll start eating healthy, and by mid day i’m snacking or if i go all day, i eat shit for dinner. 

i do need to get back to the gym but i don’t really know what i could do without things like squats, push ups, sit ups - they all cause pelvic floor pressure which i’m not allowed to do.

here is my progress after a year of lifting and tracking calories.  you guys helped me get started and keep me committed when it gets easy to stop.  looking for any thoughts, advice, encouragement, etc.

the first three pictures are before starting, the last three were a week ago.

i’m 39, 5’11”, 185lbs.  a year ago i was 190lbs, cut down to 175lbs, bulked up to 190 lbs, cut down to 180lbs and am working towards bulking up to 195lbs before cutting my back to 185lbs again.

my routine has varied but i’m currently doing bjj 2 days a week, full body lifting 3 days a week, and hitting 10-12k steps daily.

the hardest part of this was the second cut where i was operating on 1700 calories. sapped on strength and energy, took a diet break and then moved back to bulking.

my fear is bulking too fast and feeling full/bloated all the time but i’m trying to trust the process.

my split is i usually try to do two to three leg exercises (squats + something unilateral, bulgarians, variations of lunges + hip thrust or rdls), and an exercise for each upper body muscle group (back, chest, shoulders). i have a handful of different exercises for each of these too that i variate with. i try to progressively overload, but i feel like i've hit a plateau where i struggle to progress any more. i'm usually in the gym for 1,5 to 2 hours, with warmup for half an hour included in that.
my diet is ok-ish, i don't track my food very well but i eat as much as i can and also have some protein powder on the recovery days + right after a work out.

so my question is why am i always so sore? i've heard that doms doesn't necessarily equate muscle growth. i also struggle a bit with understanding hypertrophy in combination with reps and adding weight, like endurance vs muscle mass. i've been trying to grow my shoulders, but for the last year i'm still shoulderpressing the same weight and have a really hard time progressively overloading here. help a girl out!

another one is protein timing, this used to be absolutely massive when i was younger, you were wasting your opportunities if you didn't have food in mouth before 30 minutes passed, and slow release casein protein before bed was mandatory. 



anyway, i was just curious if you guys look at it and say the shit is the same, nothing has changed, or if there are legitimate big changes that you've seen in any of the core concepts of fitness.",neutral

0.99,1dtgsae,JubJubsDad,63,In Praise of Deadlifts,"i’ve seen a lot of posts asking about injury risk around deadlifts and questioning whether it’s worth it to do them so i figured i’d share my story around them. 

7 years ago i was in my early 40s and had a ‘bad back’. every few months i’d bend over to pick something up, tie my shoe, or just move wrong and my back would lock up. i’d have a couple of days of struggling to get out of bed and a couple of weeks of lingering pain and then a few months later the cycle would repeat. it sucked! and babying my back only seemed to make it worse. 

i was lifting weights, but i was avoiding deadlifts and squats because of the ‘risk’, but after spending some time over in /r/weightroom and listening to their ‘anti-glassback’ talk i figured i would give them a spin. 

so i started super light - 5x5’s at 65lbs (the bar + 10lbs/side). and i progressed slowly - only when i could easily hit a 5x5 did i add 10lbs. and i never maxed out. 

and slowly my back got better. the intervals between incidents got longer and longer and i recovered quicker (partly because i figured out the cure for back tweaks is to keep moving and do a ton of super light deadlifts). 

these days i’m pushing 50 and my back is bulletproof. i can’t remember the last time i tweaked it (despite adding in heavy triples and singles a few years back), and i’m strong af - 405lbs is an easy 5x5 for me. and within the past few months i’ve hit [a triple at 495lbs](https://streamable.com/1hwk4t) and a [2in deficit single at 515lbs](https://streamable.com/j2pamd). 

so, if your back’s bothering you, maybe give deadlifts a shot. start out light and progress slowly. you’re going to be doing deadlifts in life anyway (what do you think you’re doing anytime you pick something up off the floor?), so you might as well train for them.",neutral

i’m embarrassed to even ask because there’s so much going on in that unicorn of a routine. however, as i get older (42 in 9 days), i don’t need to bench press or squat what i did when i was 25+. having muscles feels good and looks good (i’m sure many of our wives/husbands/significant others would agree), and i’m all for having a muscular build, but it doesn’t have to be a beach body. i’ll take healthy and strong over the type of body i may have gone for prior to marriage and kids. 


now, i’m much more interested in a balanced approach that keeps me strong, but also leaves time for the other qualities mentioned in the title. if i may be dramatic for a second, if the world ended tomorrow, i’d want to be strong/flexible/functional/capable enough to do what i needed to do. focusing on what i focused on in college wouldn’t necessarily get me there. i’ve briefly read about the 4-2-1 method (4 strength sessions per week, 2 cardio, and 1 mobility) and that piqued my interest, but i’m curious if any routine exists that hits all of those mentioned above? or would it be better to take 8-12 weeks and focus on heavier weights with less frequent balance/stability/flexibility, then 8-12 with lighter weights with more body weight/cardio/yoga/balance?

1.0,1dt88ke,KookyMonitor7530,1,Question about gaining muscle with functional training - (body recomp journey),"hi everyone. first of all, i'm sorry if some of the things i'm going to ask seem very basic or silly, i'm kind of new in doing proper and organized training. so here it goes:

i'm f32 and 160cm (i think that's about 5'2) and currently weight about 51kg (which is about 113lbs). i've been trying to do body recomp for the past year and a half, which made me lose a lot of fat weight (i think in the past 2 years i lost about 8-10kg of fat just by changing a few habits). i'm currently trying to focus on gaining muscle, which i haven't been able to do too much, i've just pretty much maintained my muscle while losing fat. (i know all of this because of anthropometrics done by a nutritionist).

the current type of workout i found i enjoy is in this gym which offers personalized functional training, and which i'm starting this month (previously i was doing functional personal training but with bodyweight mostly). i don't really know the broad definition of functional training but this is what they will make me do in my new gym: whole body workouts including things like squats and similar, things for legs and things for upper body, and they use elements like the use of dumbells of 2 and 3kg (4lbs and 6lbs) to start with, and the use of kettlebells of about 5kg (11lbs) to start with, sometimes trx, sometimes ankle weights of 1kg to start with, sometimes an elastic band, and functional exercises in general.

is it ok to do the whole-body functional training this way twice a week? is it healthy to do it even 3 times a week or is it too much for a whole body training like that?

is it ok if i do one of those trainings wednesday afternoon (430pm) and then the following one is friday morning (8 or 10am)? or is that not enough time between sessions? that's the best i could do because of schedule but maybe i can try to move up the wednesday one two hours earlier or so, as in 230pm.

i also go out biking about once a week.

i'll be sure to add the proper amount of protein to my diet as well.

my aim is to have more defined and toned look, especially in legs. and of course, gain muscle in general.

do you think this type of training will help me archive my goal or doing strength training machine is a must?

i’m generally pro-apple but this app keeps going left when i expect it to go right, and when problems come up in the middle of a workout they can throw off your groove. i had one workout about a month ago where i was 3 seconds off of a pb pace and most of that was fiddling with my watch. 

i really don’t understand what they are thinking and i figure some other app probably has it sorted out and i’m hoping you guys can direct me somewhere good. 

i need something that works standalone (i leave the phone at home). i need 1/2 km split pace audio alerts to keep me from wandering off pace. i need something that can juggle pace and zone alerts and knows that splits should trump zone alerts (apple does not and this is bs). 

i also want something that doesn’t count pauses when figuring out pb times. this one shocked me the most. i had a great day last week where i think i figured out a slow start/reverse split problem on a long workout, and so i was knocking out pbs left and right. but i only got credit for 5k in the app because i paused at around 9km. and because of the way they do their splits it’s going to me complicated math to write them down by hand. 

that one made me so bad i almost called apple to yell at them about that. 

it would also be great if it could track custom distances for prs. i’m at 18k now and i’m pretty sure it won’t tell me about a pb until i hit 20k, which is quite a wall. congratulating me for doing 10k when i was well over 15k seems like faint praise.

i recently started a new position at work which has very long hours and a lot of international travel. for example, in the 4 weeks since starting, i have been on 4 continents and 18 cities, with 7 days at home. as you can imagine, getting to all these places entails a lot of early mornings paired with late nights,not to mention considerable jetlag. while i'm traveling, it's pretty rare that i'll have unscheduled time. i'm averaging 4-5 hours of sleep, and i can't find much of a way to squeeze exercise in (although i have bought a jump rope which i'll start taking with me for a quick workout in the morning). at this point, while i'm on the road, i'm basically trying to just keep my calories under control, because that's about all i can really influence at this point. 

my strategy is to squeeze in as much gym time as possible when i'm not on the road. since it can be weeks between stops at home, it's going to be hard to make a lot of progress, but at least i should be able to prevent myself from backsliding...right? 

so now my questions to you redditors: is anyone out there in a similar boat (or have you been in the past)? any strategies for keeping fitness on the forefront? any tips for not burning out?  suggestions for maintaining a nutritious diet when you don't have much of a say over what you're eating, and no opportunity to cook? other ways to sneak in some exercise on the road, especially to maintain some muscle mass?

at the end of 2019, at age 48, i decided that the way i looked and felt was not how i wanted to proceed into my 50s, so i decided to turn my life around. in january 2020, i quit drinking, quit smoking, started working out and eat healthily. it was a lot, but i was highly motivated.

my body didn't like that. first, a frozen shoulder made any movements of my left arm pretty painful for about a year. so, i turned to bodyweight leg days and long walks. then an autoimmune disease (graves') hit me that leads to muscle weakness in the legs for a change (among many other things). that went undiagnosed for a long time during covid. i could hardly climb stairs, had to sit down to put on my shoes, was permanently exhausted, and felt really old.

so, what do you do when you are elderly  and trying to get fit? i decided to give some gentle yoga a try. i also got a heart rate tracker. then i threw the heart rate tracker away like the piece of garbage i thought it was for showing crazy numbers. because you just can't have a heart rate of about 180 (or whatever it was, i don't remember) when doing child's pose, right? that would be crazy. but the tracker was probably right, i was off. 

after i had moved countries, a health check-up for the new insurance accidentially led to a proper diagnosis and i was put on medication. things began to improve from there. i got myself a set of kettlebells, found a good yoga teacher, went swimming, cycling, and walked more. on the downside, the medication led to severe weight gain over the next 18 months. in june 2023, after 3.5 years of a ""healthy lifestyle,"" my body weight was back to its worst. 

with the medication on a low dose by then, i figured i could try to fight the weight off now, and it worked well. i started counting my calories somewhat randomly at 1500 cals/day, later upping this to 1700-1850 cals. i lost 23kg / 50 lbs over one year (most of it during the first 6 months, though, not much happening at 1850 cals). i would have preferred to get down another 5kg/10lbs, but i'm also happy with this outcome for now. 

now my plan is to stay on maintenance calories (around 2100-2200, it seems) for a while and trying to ""maingain"". my training routine is to do 1 hour of ""something"" every day on average at least. that includes 2-3 kettlebell and ring workouts (45-60 minutes each) per week. the rest is yoga, walking, cycling, and swimming.

if i push myself to do too many heavy sessions, for example five in a week, then my joints suffer and i'm generally fatigued. when i was training in my youth, i found that i needed to keep up the frequency to make progress so i'm reluctant to let it slip but i understand that my body is different now and can't recover as fast.

so, my question is, if i take proper care (warm-ups, stretches etc.), what is a reasonable exercise frequency for my mid 60s? should i focus on heavy workouts once or twice per week or split the exercises and do lighter but more frequent sessions?",curiosity

0.99,1dnki9i,Kuncussion,53,"32/M/5'6 - finished a six month cut. 8.3% on BodPod, 7.5% on DEXA.","before the start of this year, i was feeling pretty unsatisfied with how i physically felt so i decided it was time to fix that. i was probably 20% body fat at the start (inbody showed 17% but i'm skeptical of that reading, personally) and set a goal for 8% by june. wanted to get back in shape for my birthday, which was on the 17th of this month.

started out by eating a serving of oatmeal, half a serving of blueberries and half a serving of chocolate peanut butter powder mixed in, a banana (i don't measure this), two servings of unsalted peanuts, one serving of dried edamame,  one serving of whole milk mixed with one serving of levels unflavored protein powder and another half serving of chocolate peanut butter powder. i'd end the day with two slices of wheat bread with tuna and a spread of hummus with a serving of chobani yogurt. over the duration, i ended up nixing a serving of peanuts, swapped to nonfat milk because the protein:calorie ratio is better, swapped to oikos yogurt for the same reason and cut my beloved bananas in the last two weeks (this was the most difficult).

i take optimen multivitamins, cla and creatine hcl consistently (never cycle off), while i did cycle on &amp; off animal cuts for the first 5 months. in the final month, i experimented with a stack of 12.5mg of yohimbine hcl, 1g of l-tyrosine and 200 mg of caffeine anhydrous when i saw my weight loss was plateauing. i feel like this was pretty effective, especially in regards to pushing through the fatigue i was feeling in the last month.

as far as my training, i lift 6 days a week with a 4 day split of chest/triceps, back/biceps, shoulders and then legs. lifts alone take me about two hours, not including the ab work (which i do every day) and 20-30 mins of post-lift cardio i do 5 days a week.

","late 30’s, two kids, travel for work a lot, golfer. i’ve been at it since september and basically took one month off to complete my masters in december. i’ve  had some small noticeable improvements and i can definitely move more weight than when i started but i’m just not seeing the physical growth i hoped to have gained. 

i’m 5’9 170, eat close to 160-170g of protein each day. i have usually 2 devoted leg days a week and try to sneak in a few extra sets on my other days. i try to get about 25 or more sets each week balanced between quads and ham/glutes. a typical day might be 4-6 sets of squats, 3-4 extensions, 3-4 leg curls, and leg press or dl. i try to get 12 calf sets each week as well. 

i’ve spent months going heavier with 4-6 reps squatting and recently trying 8-12 reps to see if that changes things. the other exercises i usually go around 10. calves i’ve gone anywhere from 15 to failure and 25/failure (standing and sitting with weight).

my one hinderance is i need my right hip replaced (thanks skateboarding in my teen years) so going super deep on squats and other heavier lifts that put a lot of pressure on my hip can be a problem (currently get injected every 6 months until they stop working, then it’ll be replaced. got the green light from mayo clinic).

got here through if, restricting calories to 1500 a day, 30 minutes of cardio a day, annnnd… lifting! i did benefit from a mix of muscle memory and newbie gains. about 10-12 years ago, i had a decent physique from lifting at home. but it wasn’t anything like where i’m at today. and honestly, i really didn’t know what i was doing back then. but my body remembered some of it, and i had gained some fundamentals like ecentric control, and progressive overload and just stuck to that and kept pushing myself this last year.

i started out with a 6 day ppl for the first few months and then switched to a full body 3x a week just because my schedule is a bit crazy and i don't have a lot of extra time for the gym so i was trying to save some time. 

my bench went up from 145 lbs 5x5 to 180lbs 5x5.

here is where i think i went wrong though and please don't criticize me too much in the comments, i'm just looking for some guidance. first thing is that i cannot get more sleep than 5.5 hours a night. i have 2 twin toddlers, a 7 year old and i work 12 hour days. i literally isn't possible for me to get more sleep than that, and i know that can play a big role in making gains. 

second is, and i know, i know...
 i stopped working out my legs. not because i want to look imbalanced, but because i told myself that i don't have a lot of time, so if i see results in my upper body after a year, then i'll start working out my legs but in the meantime why waste my time if i'm not making any progress anywhere else anyway? stupid way of thinking, i know. especially since i read that working out your legs releases growth hormones. 

lastly, i never did deadlifts. so that's 2 compound exercises ive been neglecting (deadlifts and squats).

do you guys think that if i focused more this time  on my lower body, and started doing those compound lifts that'll i'll have some better results a year from now? any advice is appreciated. i'm extremely discouraged right now. 

sorry for the long post and thank you for your time!

my routine has shifted over time. currently i do 2x weekly resistance on a full body circuit, yoga 2-6x a week (mostly at home, but occasional group classes) and do cardio (mostly cycling) 1-2x a week. i tried running about a month ago but the impact was too much for my joints. i'm hoping to try it again when i'm a bit learner.

i’m a novice runner: 7:15 mile, 25:40 5k, 56:12 10k. my vo2max seems to be somewhere around 40-44.

problem: if i try pushing running more, my lifting pays the price and i miss a ton of my weights; however, i do lots of tempo/sprint/recovery training each week and i do 10x100 sprints, but i’m not seeing any real improvements in my runs. i stretch and drink plenty of water but my calves still burn, ankles stay sore, and at around 8:30 pace my lungs start burning about a mile in. it’s been this way for 4 weeks now.

i don’t track calories, i was hovering around 18%bf prior to increasing my running so i started eating an extra pb&amp;j for lunch but it hasn’t helped much.

i just feel incredibly fatigued and my deload weeks don’t seem to help much.

0.92,1dfv794,thepacifist20130,13,For folks who like Indian cuisine,"this post is for folks who like indian cuisine with the creamy curries,  but are on cico. 

we are an indian family, and although we do not eat “restaurant indian” food regularly, we do like indulging in “butter xxxx” or “tikka masala xxxx” sometimes. i quickly realized that these are typically done with a lot of dairy fat (cream or butter) and i wouldn’t be able to keep my calories and macros in check, given how much of the fat is really needed to make these curries work. h

so if you want to make that kind of food at home - here’s another way to do it. 

*this does require you to have a good blender. we have vitamix but i’m sure other blenders should do this as well*

dice onions and tomatoes and saute in a little oil. take the blandest vegetable you can find (we go with squash usually) and add it to the mix. add ginger and garlic if you like. add a little water and spices and let it cook for 5 minutes (until onions turn translucent). 

let this mix cool. now take it to the blender and add *very few* cashews. like 5-6 cashews for a serving for 3 people. 

blend everything for a *really* long time. blend it until it becomes like a squash soup kind of a thing. add water if needed to “move” the mix in the blender, but keep it to a minimum. once it’s done, ideally you would not want to feel any grit when you rub a little of this soup between your fingers. this is key as any grit will “give away” that it’s not made with cream/butter. the squash helps keeps it super thick and creamy without adding any flavor. so do the cashews but they add a little of the good flavor. 

for reference, the spices can be fresh or you can pick up a small box from a south indian grocery store. 

once the curry is ready, put it back on the stove. add whatever protein you want (cottage cheese cubes, chicken, grilled chicken) and cook till done. cook without cover as that allows the curry to thicken up even more.

we go medium on the spices - not the spices that add heat but more like cardamom, star anise, curry leaves etc. with the flavor, you’ll be hard pressed to realize that you are not eating a restaurant curry. it sticks wonderfully to the protein, has the appearance of a restaurant style curry and tastes like that without a lot of calories and fat. 

oh, and use turmeric powder for color. ideally the mix of turmeric, the tomatoes (and kashmiri mirch if you prefer) should give it the the color that you are used to seeing.

0.96,1dfsrx3,glacierstone,28,M/38/5'8 [178lbs to 148lbs] 11-month progress,"started a weight loss and health journey last year after changing to a less stressful job. have lost about 30lbs and did a dexa scan this week, says i'm at 13.6% body fat in this pic for reference. have learned so much about nutrition and health in the last year, i think i've made habits that will be sustainable as well. i was very into fitness in my youth but lost my way about 10-15 years ago and just now getting back into it. thanks to everyone in this sub for keeping me motivated and the great advice!!! y'all are amazing!

**weight tracking**

i tracked my weight nearly daily, so maybe this chart is interesting for some. a few thoughts from my end:

* it's wild how much variation in your weight can happen during the week. almost all the spikes in the chart are either weekends or vacations. i saw 6-7 pounds of variation some weeks! it can be really hard to see w/w progress when you blow your calorie goals over the weekend. water bloat and intestinal waste accumulation are real haha.
* giving up alcohol is really the only time i saw strong progress in weight loss. can see in july 2023 through august 2023, i stopped drinking and when i started back up in september you see material slow down. did dry january but it wasn't really enough time to see results. have been sober for the last 5-6 weeks and i think that's why you see big progress on weight here.
* i started taking creatine in march of this year. i think i was actually losing fat during the several months after i started but the creatine water gain masked the body fat loss? of course this is all speculation. no idea if creatine is actually doing anything or not.

**nutrition**

i shoot for 500 calorie deficit daily. i figure out my bmr then add 20% to gauge tde. i don't subtract anything for working out. calorie counting is absolutely key. macros, working out, sleep, alcohol avoidance, and water intake are secondary.

for macro's, i shoot for at least 1g/lb of body weight, 40-50g of fat, and fill the rest with carbs.

here is my typical meal routine:

breakfast - 2 eggs &amp; 100g of egg whites scrambled. top generously with salsa.

lunch - i meal prep frozen burritos every 2 weeks. aldi carb counter tortillas, greek yogurt base, sliced grape tomatoes, diced up grilled chicken. add seasoning of your choice.

dinner - some kind of healthier meat (turkey, fish, chicken breast, shrimp, &gt;=90/10 beef), high volume serving of a vegetable dish (salad, grilled, sauteed, etc.), and then i typically default to potatoes of some kind (usually make my own air fry french fries). sometimes i do a small portion of rice or pasta.

desert - outshine lime/lemon/tangerine fruit pop, these bad boys are only 35 calories.

snacks - homemade air pop popcorn, sauerkraut, pickles, kimchee, cottage cheese, berries, cucumber, carrot, apple, archer meat stick.

**physical activity**

i try do low intensity walk or bike every day for 20-30 minutes. once a week i play pick up soccer for 1-2 hours.

i do a chest/back, legs, arms/shoulders split usually 3 days on 1 day off. do abs almost every time i work out, typically 3 sets of 10-15 on a progressive overloadable exercise (eg machine crunch, cable crunch, hanging leg raises).

 thanks again to everyone for your support on my journey!

•narrow squats
•triple pulsing squats
•hip thrusts 
•hip bridge 
•single leg hip thrusts

0.81,1df1ozs,H3xgeist,12,Hybrid training tips (weights + cycling/running/rowing etc),"i see most people here are mostly into bodybuilding or powerlifting and not so much into endurance stuff. i used to run a lot in my teenage years but left that to focus mostly on weights in my 20s. only recently two years ago i bought a shiny new carbon road bike and fell in love with the speed, and my athletic aspirations have since molded to wanting to become both fast and strong. i'm curious to know if others share this passion as well and have found a successful routine and have reached a good level in both and what kind of training they do. i realize you cannot optimize both strength and speed at the same time since excessive muscle mass slows you down and heavy endurance training eats into recovery, but i believe there exists a balance where you can be both fast and strong at the same time.

i'm currently doing around 200 km a week on saddle and lift weights 2 times a week with a focus on big compounds dl, squat, bench, ohp and pullups. more specifically i'll do 1 interval session per week 4x8 min at rpe 7-8, 2-3 1-2 hour z2 rides and unstructured sweet spot training on commutes. for strength work i do 5x5 or 3x8-12 for the main lifts and 2-3 sets for smaller muscles like arms, abs, calves and so on. my goal is 130kg bench, 180kg deadlift and 140kg squat and for cycling 350 w ftp. i know it's a lot but i believe it's doable. fergus crawley has some good stuff on  youtube but they guy's numbers are so astronomical i'm not sure i can ever reach that level of performance haha. so if you are a biker (or runner or swimmer) who likes heavy lifting as well i'd be delighted to hear about your weekly training schedule and what kind of volumes you do.",excitement
